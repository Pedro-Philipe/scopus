AB Among wearable robotic devices, hand exoskeletons present an important and persistent challenge due to the compact dimensions and kinematic complexity of the human hand. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HandeXos-Beta (HX-β), a novel index finger-thumb exoskeleton for hand rehabilitation. The HX-β system features an innovative kinematic architecture that allows independent actuation of thumb flexion/extension and circumduction (opposition), thus enabling a variety of naturalistic and functional grip configurations. Furthermore, HX-β features a novel series-elastic actuators (SEA) architecture that directly measures externally transferred torque in real-time, and thus enables both position- and torque-controlled modes of operation, allowing implementation of both robot-in-charge and user-in-charge exercise paradigms. Finally, HX-β’s adjustable orthosis, passive degrees of freedom, and under-actuated control scheme allow for optimal comfort, robot-user joint alignment, and flexible actuation for users of various hand sizes. In addition to the mechatronic design and resulting functional capabilities of HX-β, this work presents a series of physical performance characterizations, including the position- and torque-control system performance, frequency response, end effector force, and output impedance. By each measure, the HX-β exhibited performance comparable or superior to previously reported hand exoskeletons, including position and torque step response times on the order of 0.3 s, −3 dB cut-off frequencies ranging from approximately 2.5 to 4 Hz, and fingertip output forces on the order of 4 N. During use by a healthy subject in torque-controlled transparent mode, the HX-β orthosis joints exhibited appropriately low output impedance, ranging from 0.42 to −0.042 Nm/rad at 1 Hz, over a range of functional grasps performed at real-life speeds. This combination of lab bench characterizations and functional evaluation provides a comprehensive verification of the design and performance of the HandeXos Beta exoskeleton, and its suitability for clinical application in hand rehabilitation. © 2019 The Authors

AB Due to several challenges such as faster development cycles or growing customer demands, the engineering of machines and plants is becoming increasingly complex. Methods such as model-based development and virtual commissioning (i.e. an early commissioning of plant control by means of virtual machine models) are known in theory, academia and industry. These methods can significantly contribute to face time, quality and cost challenges within the development of machines and plants. However, the application and implementation of these methods and related tools are a major task. One challenge is the integration of several models in various description languages. In addition, the usage often fails because of a lack of willingness and knowledge. In addition, innovative methods also require new work- and data flows in the respective enterprises. Therefore, the challenge is to cope with historically grown structures. For this reason, this paper proposes an approach to address the challenge of introducing model-based development and virtual commissioning in enterprises in the field of machinery and plant engineering. After presenting a novel three-step methodology to introduce these methods, the theoretical implementation of virtual commissioning is described in detail. Afterwards, an industrial application example with explanation of the realization of virtual commissioning is presented and critically discussed. Finally, a summary with results and benefits and an insight to future research aspects with regard to the design of cyber-physical system and related topics is given. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

The method exploits electroencephalogram acquisitions (EEG), and specifically the Movement Related Potentials (MRPs) (i.e., μ and β rhythms), to actuate the user intention on the mechatronic device. The EEG data are collected by only five wireless smart electrodes positioned on the central and parietal cortex area. The acquired data are analyzed by an innovative single-trial classification algorithm that, with respect to the current state of the art, strongly reduces the training time (Minimum

AB This paper shows the development, implementation and results of an i-Semester, as part of the new educational model launch by Tecnologico de Monterrey, linked to the current needs of the automotive industry, whose companies are located throughout the Mexican Republic. The i-Semester program is described as an undergraduate training program, aimed to the development of disciplinary and transversal outcomes, defined by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, through industrial experiences and real-life applications. It is explained how the i-Semester was applied to an automotive industry challenge, where the student was involved in design, analysis and validation of components for the automotive industry. Explaining the work scheme, the modules with learning content, as well as the development of the industrial challenge. This work explains the experience in two editions of i-Semester in conjunction with a training partner, the automaker company Volkswagen de México. Thirty-eight students of Automotive Design Engineering and Mechatronic Engineering careers were immersed for 18-week periods, during spring and fall 2017 each one, into instruction from the teachers, professional workshops within the company and real-life experience to solve on real-life industry problem. Six teachers from the university and five engineers from the company served as mentors, giving feedback to students looking to solve the industrial problem. The second part of the paper explains how the evaluation tools were developed and implemented. As a conclusion, comments are made on the implementation challenges, opportunities, advantages and disadvantages that this new model has with respect to the traditional education scheme. © 2019 IEEE.

AB The concepts of open educational resource and virtual community of practice stem from the need to create a new mode of learning and knowledge creation platforms that complement the classroom environment. This paper aims to find how to take advantage of outcome-based learning to advance development and mastery of competencies, skills, and professional practice as a mediating product in service of innovation. The case of consideration in this paper is an open educational resource (www.g9toengineering.com) developed by the author in 2007 and continuously maintained and updated by students from an undergraduate mechatronics engineering class as an online portal to enable knowledge sharing and transfer basing on the framework of 'acquire-reflect-share-apply'. This reflection on challenges of knowledge creation shows in particular how faculty and students collaborate to create their own learning content that is part of their course, then openly share and further develop at no cost and free from licensing obstacles. Results show that students are positive with their own understanding and knowledge building with no clear distinction between the types of knowledge. Some of the challenges of implementation practice are shared in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.

AB Mechatronic agricultural machines and equipment are continuously increasing their complexity and cost. In order to ensure their efficiency and reliability and preserve their value, it is important to actively monitor the working loads and register damaging and wear occurring on critical components. This approach needs the introduction of sensors on the machine, which allow continuous monitoring and evaluate the residual life of components. The work presents the development and testing of an innovative low-cost systems for monitoring and diagnostic of off-highway vehicles. The sensor measures the torque of a mechanical power transmissions, and it was designed especially for agricultural machinery. The torque transducer monitors the mechanical power flowing from the tractor into the gearbox and the agricultural implement and is fully integrated with the power take-off driveshaft, thus being generally applicable. The design and development of the transducer was performed following a quality function deployment approach. The system is less expensive considering the typical torque measuring system commercially available and, thanks to its wireless module and integrated power supply, it is reliable and generally applicable to many power take-off to implement combinations. © IMechE 2016.

AB This Innovative Practice Work in Progress presents the proposal and the development of a simulator for an Evolvable Production System that aims to represent a complete mechatronic system, simulate its operation, and support the learning of associated subjects. A mechatronic system is composed of mechanical and electronic modules that in turn may be associated with a software layer that is responsible for the intelligence of the entire system. This intelligence comes through interactions among software agents belonging to the software layer. The mechatronic devices are described through Finite State Machines, whose transitions are triggered by mechatronic software agents. The output of the simulator is a list with the set of skill calls, the time in which such calls are made, the respective system's answer, and the set of communication messages exchanged among the agents' peers. By using this simulator in engineering classrooms, it is possible to construct several proposals of mechatronic systems, represent those systems as complete manufacturing processes, and use intelligent software agents to simulate the complete functionality of the designed system. Afterward, with the results obtained from the simulation, students are prepared to implement real systems. The proposed simulator has been used in engineering courses at the Federal University of Amazonas, and the goal of this paper is describing the characteristics of the simulator and the results of its use in engineering disciplines. © 2018 IEEE.

AB This Innovative to Practice Work in Progress paper presents an approach to obtain synergy by implementing an integrated mechatronic project within a postgraduate program. Mechatronics has been a reference for synergetic integration of technology. However, synergy is obtained not only from technical issues, but through professional skills. Nevertheless, traditional education and industry standards focus only on the technical side. The study case is performed within the program Integrated Design of Technical Systems by implementing strategies such as integrated scheduling, integrated assessment and project proposal with application fields such as agriculture, robotics, health and mobility. This approach does not require additional credits for a project course, since the project lies underneath the courses. It has led to an increase of enrollment of students, which is significant during times when less engineers opt for further technical education. © 2018 IEEE.

AB With the development of marine resources, research on underwater robots has received unprecedented attention. The discovery and application of new smart materials provide new ideas for the research of underwater robots, which can overcome the issues of traditional underwater robots and optimize their design. A macro fiber composite (MFC) is a new type of piezoelectric fiber composite that combines actuators and sensors. The material has excellent deflection, good flexibility, and a high electromechanical coupling coefficient. Bionic mechatronics design is an effective way to innovate mechatronics in the future and can significantly improve mechatronics system performance. As an important issue for the design of bionic mechatronics, it is necessary to make robots as soft as natural organisms to achieve similar biological movement with both higher efficiency and performance. Compared with traditional rigid robots, the design and control of a soft robotic fish are difficult because the coupling between the flexible structure and the surrounding environment should be considered, which is difficult to solve due to the large deformation and coupling dynamics. In this paper, an MFC smart material is applied as an actuator in the design of bionic robotic fish. Combined with the piezoelectric constitutive and elastic constitutive equations of the MFC material, the voltage-drive signal is converted to a mechanical load applied to the MFC actuator, which makes the MFC material deform and drives the movement of the robotic fish. The characteristics of caudal fin motion during the swimming process of the bionic robotic fish were analyzed by an acoustic-solid coupling analysis method. The motion control analysis of the bionic robotic fish was carried out by changing the applied driving signal. Through numerical analysis, a new type of soft robotic fish was designed, and the feasibility of using an MFC smart material for underwater bionic robotic fish actuators was verified. The new soft robotic fish was successfully developed to achieve high performance. © 2019 Chengguang Zhang.

AB Future applications of mechatronic systems will be characterized by a high degree of digitization enabling the integration of numerous innovative functions. The validation and reliability analysis of such complex systems often requires the realization of cost intensive full system prototypes and the evaluation of field tests. Innovative technologies are therefore integrated slowly in industrial sectors that focus on system reliability. Hence, there is a strong interest in a reliability orientated development and test process for complex mechatronic systems. The integration of real-time simulations in test environments allows efficient development and verification of the individual components of a mechatronic system in many cases. Currently, this especially applies for the test-driven development of embedded control units and their corresponding software. A reduced number of field tests, the automated run of test procedures and the application of error injection methods can be achieved by the widely used Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) technique. In signal level HIL tests, an existing control unit is connected to a virtual real-time simulation of the residual system. If however the device under test includes a mechanical or power electrical interface, the coupling of the test object to a virtual residual system requires the application of a mechanical or power electrical HIL interface. Current activities aim for this extension of In-the-Loop technologies for the validation of mechanical and power electronic subsystems. This paper highlights the potential of combined signal level, mechanical level and power electrical HIL tests for the validation of complex mechatronic systems in an early phase of design. The paper also points out the key topics of test-driven development, real-time simulation and the realization of hybrid test environments by means of mechanical and power electrical HIL interfaces. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2019.

AB Development of electric vehicles is not only an opportunity in terms of environmental sustainability but it also offers interesting possibilities in terms of control performances that can be achieved by on board systems devoted to increase vehicle safety and stability by modulating longitudinal efforts applied to tires. It’s not only a matter of performances but also of standardization in a single integrated subsystem able to safely control vehicle dynamics of various functions that are currently implemented by different subsystems. This simplification and rationalization of the whole mechatronic system should be of fundamental importance also for the integration of autonomous or assisted driving functionalities making easier and safer system integration. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB The paper presents the author’s method of solving the problems of vibration suppression during boring of large-sized workpieces by means of an innovative method of adjusting the rotational speed of the boring bar. It consists in selecting the spindle speed in accordance with the results of the cutting process simulation. The method includes identification of the model of the finite element method of the boring bar. The Root Mean Square (RMS) values of the time plots and dominant values of the peaks in the frequency spectra were obtained during the boring process. The effectiveness of the proposed attempt is demonstrated by the selected mechatronic design technique, known as Experiment-Aided Virtual Prototyping (E-AVP). The proposed method has been verified based on the results of experimental research. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The development of such biomedical devices can help people live in a more comfortable way and allow for the execution of therapies, that are usually performed in hospitals, at home. This article presents a new wearable and portable mechatronic device for extracorporeal blood ultrafiltration, named RAP, able to remove excess fluids from overhydrated patients with chronic kidney disease and/or congestive heart failure. An innovative layout paradigm has been introduced for the RAP, involving a box-like design that can fit a backpack or a trolley, ensuring miniaturization and ergonomics, and an original-effective positioning of the components. These have been divided on three independent planar panels

This impact has resulted in both an increasing degree of automation of vehicular systems and the emergence of new concepts like integrated chassis control. To contribute to this topic, a consortium of several industrial and academic partners from EU, South Africa, and USA has performed consolidated research and innovation actions for the development of new integrated chassis control technologies within the framework of the European project EVE. This paper presents the main EVE outcomes related to the integration of active brake, suspension, and tyre pressure control. Attention is also given to the problems of vehicle and tyre modelling, state estimation, robust chassis control, and experimental validation tools. © 2019 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB This paper describes how a standard HI-tech WINner Corporation articulated six degrees of freedom (DOFs) industrial robot arm and a National Taiwan University five-finger robotic hand was equipped with additional hardware and software to enable the resulting machine to play chess with a human chess player. For automatic interaction with the human player, moves were recorded by a webcam and automatically analyzed. No manual (keyboard) input was necessary. The chess-playing robotic system has been provided. An innovative humanoid robotic hand with 12 DOFs and 19 joints were designed, and distributed tactile sensor arrays with 376 detecting points on its surface were developed. The hand can communicate with the external through controller area networks bus. For performance evaluation of the designed robotic hand, we analyzed the workspace, intersection volume, and manipulability. First, several anatomical analyses were conducted prior to a decision on the kinematic design. Optimization procedures were then developed in this study to improve the parameters of the design and structure of the mechanism. The concepts of a series elastic actuator and an under-actuated mechanism were also employed to give the robotic hand a compliant property and high dexterity; hence, a humanoid robotic hand was devised. Since the robotic hand is as small and dexterous as a human hand, it can be conveniently used for a wide range of applications. Finally, the system has been proved to be executable in a complex environment. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Since 2013, the Tecnologico de Monterrey has been implementing the Tec21 Educational Model, which promotes student participation under the challenge-based learning framework. This places students in challenging, and interactive learning experiences. One of the central proposals of the Tec21 model is the posing of challenges to the student so that he/she develops disciplinary and cross-disciplinary skills. In this paper, we report the results of four learning experiences based on challenges where students from Mechanical, Mechatronics and Sustainable Development Engineering undergraduate programs were immersed into real-life challenges of three different world-leading companies (namely Boehringer Ingelheim, Covestro and Becton–Dickinson). These challenges were designed by personnel from the companies and professors from Tecnologico de Monterrey. Skills required in these work places, such as work collaboration, critical thinking, ethics and resilience, were compared with those developed under a school-controlled environment. Our results demonstrated that a CBL experience with an industrial partner increases complexity and uncertainty levels. Consequently, the development of skills is consistently higher compared to learning delivered via traditional methods. In our experimental set up, the learning modules were designed to achieve the goals of both the company and the school. The challenges brought forth issues such as ethical dilemmas, valorization, design planning, scientific methodology and recycling options of solid waste products. We analyzed the resilience of the students to failure, their solutions to the challenges and the knowledge acquisition from the contents of every single learning module. The main difference between having a school-controlled challenge and a highly undefined challenge developed at an industrial plant is the level of uncertainty about solving the problem(s). A lot of factors were evident in our study; for example, cross-disciplinary skills, such as teamwork (collaboration), critical thinking, ethics, problem-solving, planning ahead and resilience were observed. Our results demonstrated that having an industrial partner in the Challenge-Based-Learning experience is essential to increase the complexity of the challenge and the uncertainty level, and it helps dramatically in exposing students to real-life professional problems that need to be solved. © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB In-situ aeroengine maintenance works (e.g. inspection, repair) are highly beneficial as it can significantly reduce currently accepted maintenance cycle which is extensive and costly due to the need to remove engines from the wing of an aircraft. However, feeding in/out via inspection ports and performing a multi-axis movement of an end-effector in a very constrained environment such as aeroengine combustion chamber is a fairly challenging task. This paper presents the design and development of a highly slender (i.e., low diameter-to-length ratio) dual-structure continuum robot with 16 degrees of freedom (DoFs) to provide the feeding motion needed to navigate into confined environments and then perform a required configuration shape for further repair operation. This continuum robot is a compact system and presents a set of innovative mechatronic solutions such as

AB In order to be able to successfully compete in global markets, producers have to introduce innovative solutions, both in the technologies themselves and in the organization of manufacturing. They must ensure high, stable quality and efficiency, as well as meet the expectations of the recipients of the product, including rhythmicity of supplies, the ability to quickly switch production to another model, documenting and archiving the data of manufacturing process. These requirements can be met by installations with a high level of automation, using the latest Industry 4.0 concepts. An example of such an approach is implementing the technology of the automated assembling of gas spring sockets. In the paper, the manufacturing machine which realises this technology is presented. The advanced mechatronic solutions, using modern control systems, sensors, a human-machine interface with a conversational communication system and ICT tools, were integrated with it. © 2018 Author(s).

AB Mechatronic rehabilitative devices have been proven to provide cost effective solutions to long term physical therapy for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. However, current actuator technologies limit the minimization of the overall size and weight of these devices preventing innovation into unobtrusive wearable form factors that are also effective and comfortable. This study is focused on a recently discovered smart actuator made from flexible nylon thread, which has exhibited a great potential for use in wearable mechatronic devices. This is known as the twisted coiled actuator (TCA) due to the hyper twisting and induced coiling involved in its fabrication process. One of the limiting factors of the TCA, is the thermal activation mechanism, which results in a slow cooling phase and a low working bandwidth. This paper is focused on optimizing an active cooling design using numerical analysis. To do this, a simple pipe geometry was designed and tested using fluid dynamics software. Three off-the-shelf fluidic pumps were simulated using varying tube diameters to find a sufficient cooling rate, a minimum fluid volume, and to select a proper pump for future testing. The results indicate that a global maximum cooling rate exists for each specific pump at a unique tube diameter. Additionally, the speed of cooling was under 500 ms concluding that the pumps tested can sufficiently provide the cooling rates required to assist motion in wearable devices. Furthermore, the process developed here provides quantitative support for the optimal selection of initial design parameters and can be translated to designs using different form factors and fluid properties. © 2018 IEEE.

AB The current innovation of the mechatronic products has led to the use of miniaturized devices that combine components with different material, shape, reduced mass, and extremely small size, in order to increase the functionalities and the efficiency of the products. This trend involves new issues related to the manufacturing and automated assembly of these products. Even in constantly developing non-industrial sectors such as biomedicine, the need for automated equipment for preparing and manipulating biological samples represents a current challenge. In particular, the sorting and feeding systems cover an essential role since they can affect the task strategy, the operation scheduling, and the overall system performance. Moreover, they should cope with the adhesion issues related to micro-scale manipulation, as all the devices that handle sub-millimetric components. In this context, this paper presents two methods and the related tools for the automated sorting and manipulation of micro-spheres

AB A multidisciplinary co-development experience is nowadays required for students to be able to function properly in the industrial development environments. More and mechatronic systems such as autonomous robots, 3D printers and dexterous manipulators are developed. This paper describes a new and innovative way for involving students of the various classical disciplines in complex mechatronic engineering assignments. These assignments are intended to enhance the students' engineering skills by working in a multidisciplinary team during the so-called Smart Solutions Semester (3S). The projects are always part of a larger public-private cooperation (PPS) project of the research group with companies. The coaching of the student's team is carried out by the researcher involved as the systems engineer in the research groups' project team. Operating in this manner involves students directly into the research and creates a win-win situation for both students, researchers and companies. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Mechatronics has traditionally been considered a simple combination of mechanical and electrical systems, but as technology and capability have advanced, the field of mechatronics has expanded to include mechanical engineering, electronics, computer engineering, and controls engineering. This multidisciplinary nature of mechatronics makes it an ideal basis from which to construct new capabilities and knowledge. As a mandatory senior level course for mechanical engineers at The Citadel, mechatronics is a course that allows students to exercise their creativity and problem solving skills in a multidisciplinary way. Upon entering this course, many students comprehend some basics of several of the constitutive disciplines, but now must work to integrate these areas while implementing new devices. This paper describes four hands-on labs that progress in difficulty. These challenges follow the course material and design, pushing the students to work through the lecture material and example problems. Students are encouraged to think about the final product they will present, and work towards implementing portions of it in each lab requirement. For those that adhere to this advice, the final integration is much easier than those who treat each lab as a disjointed exercise. Each lab requirement has at least one in-class work session, and two require the student teams to present their prototype or proof of concept. The faculty member who teaches the course and a lab technician are available to support the groups and provide additional information or assistance on implementing their devices. Student reviews (4.35 out of 5 on evaluations) and grades show they are meeting the desired learning objectives and enjoy the challenges (4.40 out of 5 on evaluations). Students with no prior programming experience in C++ quickly gain proficiency and are more confident with their critical thinking, creativity, and problem solving skills as well as their ability to be self-learners. Instructors report that the hands-on nature motivates students to achieve more than the bare minimum and be creative. Their imaginations and innovative solutions require the integration of introductory computer programming and microcontroller functions with electrical and mechanical engineering applications. Students mention the open ended, hands-on activities in the course feedback as relevant applications that helped them improve their understanding and appreciation for the theory learned in the classroom. Additionally, students have learned to incorporate some of the lab requirements into their senior capstone projects. Working through the labs provides an excellent vehicle for deeper understanding and solving open-ended problems while contributing to a number of ABET student outcomes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

AB This paper describes the evidence-based use of a hackathon model to address student learning outcomes in first-year Engineering programs. There is a growing body of work around the use of hackathons to promote engagement, innovation, teamwork, and problem-solving in engineers before, during, and after their undergraduate studies. Existing hackathons tend to be open, extracurricular events with a focus on software and UX/UI design. While some have a theme to steer students towards a particular problem space, there is an absence of literature regarding the use of hackathons in-class to support course-level learning objectives. We created in-class, curricular hackathons that have been deployed in four different undergraduate programs (Computer, Electrical, Mechanical, and Mechatronics Engineering) on five separate occasions, with another two upcoming offerings. This model, which we call Engineering Design Days, has been implemented in slightly different ways to engage the various cohorts of students and to investigate best practices. Each instance is two days with no traditional classes, labs, or tutorials, where the students work in teams to design and build solutions to open-ended problems. These problems are designed to integrate knowledge from across multiple courses. Students solve design problems by making physical systems using off-the-shelf components. The solutions are presented and tested in front of their peers at the end of the second day. Students and course instructors from each implementation provided feedback through surveys, focus groups, and interviews. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and indicates an increase in students' affective domain valuing of the roles of creativity, analysis, and investigation in engineering design. The adoption of Engineering Design Days is expanding across the Faculty of Engineering as a result. We discuss lessons-learned and strategies for ensuring the sustainability of Engineering Design Days. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

AB Mechatronics expresses the close integration of mechanics, electrics/electronics, control engineering and software engineering. The design of mechatronic systems follows the traditional point-based design method, which drawback is the decrease of the potential of innovation, by limiting the design space to few solutions. The Set-Based Concurrent Engineering SBCE, however, begins by broadly considering sets of possible solutions and gradually narrowing the set of possibilities to converge on a final solution. Nevertheless, few industrials in the mechatronic field are using SBCE concept, because of the difficulty to implement it. In this paper, we show how to apply the SBCE concept for mechatronic systems, with an application to an industrial case study of an Electronic Throttle Body (ETB), used to regulate the amount of air in an internal combustion engine. The results show that with a well-structured SBCE process model, we can explore the big number of solutions that we generate when dealing with mechatronic systems, and then we progressively reduce the set of possibilities to the final system design. © 2018 IEEE.

AB New adaptive complex systems are required in order to tackle Industry 4.0 challenges. These Industry 4.0 compliant systems (Cyber Physical Production System) will mainly rely on mechatronics and CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) concepts. Thus, it is important to have a better understanding of the available synergies between these three concepts, the main goal being the adaptability of manufacturing systems related to the variability of new innovative manufactured products. In this paper, a CPPS conjoint design process based on mechatronic systems and CPS is proposed. In order to better design such complex manufacturing systems, a conjoint design process encompassing the design of the innovative product and its manufacturing system is developed. © 2018 IEEE.

AB This study aims to design a modified project-based learning model and a series of courses in riderless bicycle scenario to cultivate students' professional knowledge, practical skills and core competencies. The riderless bicycle scenario is not only familiar to students and rich in a large number of theoretical and practical research topics but also integrates mechatronics engineering subjects from the freshman year to the senior year. Through the series of courses, students are allowed to have project-based learning in this scenario so as to cultivate the necessary professional knowledge, practical skills and core competencies for entering the industry in the future. The series of courses include the introduction, in-depth, and transformation courses. The introduction courses guide students about the scenario and establish their framework relation and basic understanding about the various subjects of mechatronics engineering. The in-depth courses allow the students to gradually design and actually fabricate the riderless bicycle. During the process, they can study and integrate the various subjects and disciplines in depth as well as develop independent learning, innovative thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills and other core competencies. The transformation courses help the students internalize their knowledge and experience in the scenario, translating them into other practical applications and connecting with the industry. This study designed a learning workshop for actual implementation and conducted a survey afterward on to make a preliminary assessment of the feasibility and basic functions of the riderless bicycle as a project-based learning and teaching scenario and to collect feedback from students to serve as the reference for the design and improvement of follow-up curriculum series. © 2018 IEEE.

AB Electric drive production planning for electric mobility traction applications is characterized by an extensive information demand due to a complex production sequence with a broad differentiated technology portfolio, steady disruption as well as low experience of new players such as automotive OEM and startup businesses in the respective field. Taking into account the intense competitiveness regarding sales and therefore production prices, shortening time to market and a broad technological diffusion of product technologies and components, efficiency in product development processes and consecutively production planning processes gains a major focus for innovating and disrupting companies. Due to a high level of maturity in early development stages, prototyping for mechatronic systems and especially electric drives offers an extensive but mostly unexploited source to gather information along these hardware processes that enables or supports production planning processes and increases their efficiency. Due to high costs for hardware experiments, a fixed location within development phase process models and missing theoretical and practical examination of this field, potentials are not exploited comprehensively. This paper presents an approach to abolish the aforementioned technical and organizational barriers and shows how a structured information planning process as well as flexible prototyping phases within product development regarding schedule and content can enable efficiency increase within innovation processes. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Producing companies are forced to a continuous development of new product innovations in shorter development cycles. The integration of mechatronic components with simultaneous high demands on quality and costs results in a significant increase of complexity. Therefore, the necessity to handle this rising product complexity requires a sustainable conceptual realignment of the current product development process. An approach to face this challenge is provided by the application of methods used for agile software development. These methods have helped the software industry for years to a measureable optimization of the success factors time, quality and costs. Referring to these successes, a method is developed which allows a systematic transmission of agile mechanisms of action towards development processes of technical products. In a first step, applied agile practices are identified and clustered to common so-called agile mechanisms of action. The second step considers their influence on the adjustment of deterministic process elements. © 2017 IEEE.

AB TAF Agile Framework addresses the challenge of providing a methods framework for agile mechatronic product development. It aims to reduce uncertainty towards the product within minimum time and resources by taking a holistic, interdisciplinary perspective on the product and iteratively increases knowledge by applying the scientific method to the domains of desirability, feasibility and viability. It crystallizes this knowledge by building prototypes and artifacts to disseminate it quickly throughout large teams. It integrates best practices from traditional mechatronic development (e.g. Munich Procedural Model) with methods inspired by lean startup, scrum and design thinking. It coordinates cross-functional teams and helps to identify critical functions in order to build the right things before building them right. TAF is applied wherever companies need to adapt to a changing market, where the current business model or rather product lost its viability and where mechatronic products are developed de-novo. In this study, TAF Agile Framework is deduced from the combined experience of 37 agile mechatronic development projects and evaluated with the results of 13 further projects during a two weeks lab course at TU Munich. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Consumerism pertains to the rapid growth in demand of the citizen's needs due to the continuous increase of population. In consumerism, a large-scale production is done to cope up with people's needs. Currently, automated machines are used to replace human operators in several factories to lessen the mechanical work load of employees. In supermarkets, there is a huge margin of inaccuracy that can be attributed to human error. This includes the possibility of incorrect price, loss of goods and unreliable sorting of goods. Let's also take into account the amount of manpower and labor that goes into the process. The research group's project is an insight into implementing an automated checkout counter and bagging system to reduce the margin of error. The project targets to present a more efficient checkout system in supermarkets by decreasing the amount of manpower. Information on how the automated bagging and checkout counter is built and how it works is presented. © 2017 IEEE.

AB This paper gives a brief overview of the design, layout and functionality of components for hydroforming automation process of thin-walled elements. The present system includes a high pressure pump, electromagnetic directional control valve, a two-part die, the measuring system with pressure and feed sensors and supporting software for measurement and analysis, and feedback to the valve. Hydroforming process of thin-walled elements involves the production of pieces, usually a very complex shape, from tubes and sheets. Typical examples of the use of this process is the automotive, aerospace industry, manufacturing of medical equipment, and home appliances. One of the important factors for the performance of the process is a technological development of system that includes automation and process control. Mechatronic systems are characterized by certain level of autonomy. They react autonomously to changes in the environment and working conditions, using algorithms for control. They are flexible and simple. The modification of the system may be quick and easy. In practice, the combination of hydroforming and mechatronics occurs as a mechatronic hydroforming system. The mechatronic hydroforming system is an innovative approach to hydroforming of thin-walled elements wherein the process automates and controlled via software. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB Purpose – Several studies have aimed to develop robotic systems which move in transmission lines. Until this moment, all of them have a high weight and cost associated with the equipment and reduced battery autonomy time. In this context, this paper aims to propose the POLIBOT (POwer Lines Inspection roBOT) with low cost and weight, enabling the movement over the lines and an easier installation and remove. Design/methodology/approach – The designed robot uses the Profiles Manufacturing Methodology (PMM). The construction of the robot mechanical structure uses modularized aluminum parts built through square profiles. Thus, it's possible a drastic reduction in production time as well as cost reduction and weight when comparing this method with other manufacturing processes like foundry, for example. For hardware and software systems, the use of free and open source software causes a significant reduction in cost and project execution time. The benefits of using open source systems are immeasurable, both from academic and industrial applications. Findings – The POLIBOT platform is one solution to the problem of inspection in power lines. With this robot, more lines are maintained with lower time. In its constructive aspect, the robotic mechanism is designed using principles of bioengineering. The use of this principle was successful, considering that obstacle transposition is performed with stability and low energy consumption. Research limitations/implications – The suggestion for future researches is to replace the battery for solar energy and construction in polymeric material to avoid high magnetic fields. Practical implications – The commercial application is evident because manual inspections are inefficient, very expensive and dangerous. Thus, it is growing the number of researches that develop mechatronics systems for this kind of inspection. Social implications – The impact is the reduction of accidents because the present procedure requires precision of movements, where the pilot and electrical technician are close to high electrical and magnetic fields. In addition, for some tasks, the worker has to walk on the line to reach some important points. Thus, those tasks involve high risk of death. Originality/value – The PMM methodology represents an innovation to the state of the art because others robotic mechanisms proposed for inspection tasks present total structure mass between 50 and 100 kg and POLIBOT has only 9 kg. Other fact is its price for implementation as this robot used the robot operating system (ROS) framework, what dispense the use of licenses. Other important features are that the robot performs the tasks autonomously, which reduces errors introduced by the operator and its low manufacturing cost as compared with other projects. © Emerald Publishing Limited

AB From the earliest days, man has desired to create machines that would reflect on the human condition i.e. machines that would demonstrate autonomy, capacity for movement and that would learn and adapt to changing environmental conditions. For many centuries it was not possible for man to build machines and devices that would have at least some of these characteristics. It was not until the 20th century that the rapid development of knowledge in fields such as automatic control, computer science, electronics and manufacturing processes allowed for the construction of robots i.e. machines with complex mechanical structures supplied with appropriate control software that could perform certain tasks previously done by humans. Further progress continued in such areas as robotics and mechatronics i.e. disciplines that are concerned with the mechanics, design, control and operation of robots. Current development of science and technology challenges the scientific community to provide innovative engineering solutions and encourages undertaking research on optimal solutions for mechatronic systems which include, inter alia, wheeled mobile robots and robotic manipulators. The issues relating to mechatronics are of interdisciplinary nature and require the knowledge of multiple disciplines. In particular, wheeled mobile robots are nonlinear, nonholonomic mechatronic systems composed of interacting mechanical, electrical, electronic components and software. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB The Research, Technological Development and Innovation System of SENA (SENNOVA) of Colombia, has the purpose of strengthening the standards of quality and relevance, through programs and projects as Tecnoacademias, defined as a STEM learning scenario, equipped with emerging technologies to develop innovation-oriented skills, through project training, to students of basic and secondary education, in courses such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, applied sciences such as Robotics, Nanotechnology, Biotechnology and Virtual Technologies. This work presents some of the activities carried out by the apprentices through the Educational Robotics in Tecnoacademia Risaralda and Tecnoacademia Caldas sites, based on Industrial and Mechatronic Design methodologies, using LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 kits and Design Thinking for educators and LEGO, successfully applied in the EducarChile program. It is based on three fundamental pillars, which are empathy, collaboration and experimentation, which are presented in the five (5) phases of the methodology. It should be noted that the tools of innovation and prototyping per se, do not serve much if the team that executes them is not immersed in a culture of tolerance, teamwork, leadership and if there is no feedback and if the capacities are not taken into account and strengths of the work team. All this was achieved through different prototypes of robots of light and robust type originated in a PON scenario (problem, opportunity, needs). © 2018 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB Prototyping in general is a widely used procedure within the product development process. Prototypes help to understand different and complex phenomena, support the communication between developers and customers and lower the risk of undesirable developments. There is however a lack of described methods for the development of the prototype itself to gain a maximum of knowledge. This paper therefore postulates a method for the development of early prototypes by identification of the critical properties of the final product. These properties lead to requirements for the prototype. Copyright © 2002-2018 The Design Society. All rights reserved.

AB Many experiences in engineering education boast positive gains to students’ learning and achievement. However, current literature is less clear on the economic costs associated with these efforts, or methods for performing said analyses. To address this gap, we proposed a structured approach to analyzing the incremental costs associated with an experience in engineering education. This method was modeled after those found in medicine and early childhood education. We illustrated our methodology using marginal (above baseline) time and cost ingredients that were collected during the development, pilot, and steady-state phases of a mechatronic experience in a first-year undergraduate engineering technology course. Specifically, our method included descriptive analysis, Pareto analysis, and cost per capacity estimate analysis, the latter of which has received limited discussion in current cost analysis literature. The purpose of our illustrated explanation was to provide a clear method for incremental cost analyses of experiences in engineering education. We found that the development, pilot, and steady-state phases cost just over $17.1k ($12.4k for personnel and $4.7k for equipment), based on 2015 US$ and an enrollment capacity of 121 students. Cost vs. capacity scaled at a factor of – 0.64 (y = 3,121x –0.64 , R 2 = 0.99), which was within the 95% interval for personnel and capital commonly observed in the chemical processing industry. Based on a four-year operational life and a range of 20–400 students per year, we estimated per seat total costs to range from roughly $70–$470, with our mechatronic experience averaging just under $150 per seat. Notably, the development phase cost, as well as the robot chassis and microcontroller capital cost were the primary cost terms of this intervention. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.

AB There can be no innovation without time and space for ideation and courage to endeavor new terrain. Approaching this terrain in a structured way whilst managing the risks linked to the uncertainty of the novel is a major advantage of agile process models such as Scrum. On the other hand, most companies in mechatronic product development organize their activities in Stage-Gate-Processes for good reasons. This paper thus aims at combining the benefits of traditional and agile process models. The core assumption is, that even in overall complex projects, only a certain amount of tasks really benefits from agile practices. In order to identify these project elements, a differentiated view on project complexity is necessary. This differentiation is then integrated into a tool for analyzing task entropy as a measure of unknowingness and thus potential for agile approaches. These agile approaches are considered to be timebound episodes of concentrated problem solving with restricted ressources. Thus, theories about human problem solving and multitasking serve as a fundament for the conceptualization of short-term agile workshops. By restricting the duration of these workshops to two to five days, the barrier of practicing agile methods in arbitrary process landscapes is significantly lowered. The question arising is how proven agile practices can be scaled to these small time scopes while retaining the valuable, structuring elements such as fixed sprints and regular meetings. On the fundament of ASD - Agile Systems Design, this paper presents guidelines for implementation of agile workshops on smaller time scopes based on three pillars

AB Regional innovation systems (RISs) are increasingly emerging in less developed areas. Based on the case study of the mechatronic cluster in the Italian southern region, Apulia, this paper analyses how institutions have managed to promote the establishment of a RIS in disadvantaged areas. Through a longitudinal analysis over more than half a century, the Apulian case study shows that the creation of this RIS in less developed areas is the result of a dynamic process characterised by a multi-level governance, initially promoted by the central government through a top-down logic, and then integrated by action of local actors through a bottom-up approach. A key role is played by the regionalisation of innovation policies and by the strategic action of regional public institutions to promote the interaction among enterprises and universities. Our analysis highlights that several ingredients should simultaneously occur for a regional innovation policy to be effective. Any regional innovation strategy significantly lacking one of these core pre-conditions and ingredients is risky. Policy-makers should carefully study the opportunities and challenges arising from local contexts before embarking in ambitious place-based innovation strategies.

AB The article deals with the architecture, performance, and experimental tests of a test bench for servo-actuators used in flight controls. After the state of the art on the subject, the innovative architecture of the built bench is described, in which flight control actuator under test and load actuator are not in line but mounted perpendicularly. The model of the bench actuating systems is then presented, consisting of the servo-controlled hydraulic actuator, load cell, speed transducer, angular position transducer of the coupling and pressure transducers. For each of these components the nonlinear multi-physics mechatronic model is described, according to the adopted solutions. The adopted force control algorithm is discussed, showing the integrative compensation on the action line and proportional-derivative on the feedback, with speed feedforward. The experimental tests carried out on the bench under stalled conditions are also presented, whose results concerning time and frequency responses are compared with those obtained through the linearized and non-linear numerical model. Finally, the non-linear models of the flight control actuator under test, controlled in position, and of the loading servo-actuator of the bench are joined together, and the results of various simulations are described.

AB Following the technological advances in recent decades, advanced electronic systems linked to the gas turbine industry are increasingly considered by the designers of this field. For this purpose, new airborne systems in conjunction with jet engines are developed, which are incorporated in many challenging design problems such as control law and configuration design. Thus, a comprehensive modeling structure is needed that can bolster the integrity of the system development such as the bond graph approach, which is known as an efficient method for modeling complicated mechatronic systems. In this paper, modeling and simulation of a jet engine dynamic performance and aircraft motion are achieved based on the bond graph approach. At first, the electric starter bond graph model is constructed and physical relationships governing each engine component are obtained. In the aftermath, the modulated energy fields are developed for the jet engine components. Subsequently, the bond graph model of the engine is numerically simulated and experimentally tested and verified for a small jet engine. Finally, bond graph modeling and simulation of integrated engine and aircraft system is presented. The test results indicate the acceptable accuracy of the modeling approach which can be applied for innovative diagnosis and control systems design. © IMechE 2018.

AB The Automotive industry is currently undergoing a dramatic innovation. Mechatronic solutions integrate knowledge about mechanics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and informatics. Generations of students were specialising on one field, while current solutions require architects that can combine these different subject fields to one solution in automotive industry. For instance, battery systems require nowadays such a combination of skills, where chemistry is used to build Li cells. Physics is used to create the circuit and resistors to control the loading of cells. Voltage sensors are used as input to an electronic (ECU – Electronic control unit) to control loading and avoid overloading. And temperature sensors are an input to the ECU to identify temperature and avoid overheating and outgasing of explosive H gas. Mathematical models are used in the control algorithms. And Software I developed and executed on the ECU. Etc. The future car industry needs engineers to think outside the box, across different disciplines and who are capable of multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural team-working. ELIC (Engineering Literacy Online - Teachers as Medium for Change) is an EU project supported under the Erasmus+ program which develops an ECQA (European Certification and Qualification Association) compliant skills set and exam for teachers, as well as a MOOC platform to train teachers to teach interconnected science examples for Automotive. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB Nowadays, robotic systems are not an exclusive of the industry environment anymore. Indeed, in the last decades, they assumed an important role in other application fields such as medicine (e.g. robot-assisted surgery) and agriculture (e.g. fruit picking). To meet the requirements of these new fields of application, this transition has involved both an adaptation of old-technologies and the development of new ones. In the agricultural field, the objects to be manipulated are usually characterized by non-uniform shapes, dimensions and weights. Moreover, they are typically soft and fragile, so they need to be handled with care. To accomplish these requirements, several types of new grippers have been created or adapted, also thanks to recent developments in manufacturing technologies and materials. However, many of these innovative grippers are either at a prototyping stage or expensive. This applied-research work wants to investigate the innovative available low-cost grippers able to deal with objects of different dimensions, weights and surface conformation, which could be employed in productive sectors such as agriculture. In particular, the few information (i.e. maximum object diameter and weight, durability) given by producers are supplemented with data on gripper capability to handle statically and dynamically objects with the aforementioned characteristics. Such data have been obtained through several experimental tests (i.e. pick & place operations) and provide a set of gripper-characteristic-maps that allows evaluating the gripper adequacy for a given application. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB Traditional Engineering curricula do not include Design Thinking content in mandatory courses. Therefore, this content often faces strong resistance when offered in a modern curriculum, due to not being seen as part of the commonly accepted definition of an Engineer. Pushing a cultural shift or building an admission process that minimizes such resistance would be effective solutions, but are too slow to be implemented in the short term. On the other hand, there has been an increase on the importance of Computer Programming, particularly Front-End Development, in both Engineering and Design professions, regardless of their specific fields. In the case of Engineering, even fields that are not traditionally associated with computing, like Mechanical Engineering, are demanding a minimum of programming skills. In the case of Design, it gained popularity as a tool for digital prototyping and portfolio building. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Co-Design of Applications course, offered to second semester students of a Mechanical, Mechatronics, and Computer Engineering common curriculum.

AB Today's products are characterized by a highly interdisciplinary level. Likewise, household appliances are affected to this evolution. Mechanical structures, actuators, sensors and distributed control units can be found in modern tumble dryers, as well as in other mechatronic systems. The main challenge in the development process of such systems is to ensure the functionality which contains the proper interaction within the components of the tumble dryer. Mechanical knowledge, thermodynamical expertise, control-engineering competence and knowledge in software have to be managed and brought together. Apart from the interdisciplinary challenge, the rising functionality of modern tumble dryers leads to a further challenge, which appears in the development. Intelligent processes within their components have to be tested intensively, to ensure the benefit they promise. Time-consuming iterations during the development are inacceptable, to guarantee a specified start of production. To face the mentioned challenges in the development process, Miele already applies model-based systems engineering in its development [1]. Using simulation models enables Miele to analyze a lot of different and complex concepts of tumble dryers, to consider innovative and novel ways to dry clothes. As part of these Model-in-the-Loop simulations in early phases of the development, holistic system simulation-models are established. These models basically contain physical and control behavior. Immediately after different concepts are analyzed by the virtual systems, the concepts have to be validated. This work focusses the Rapid-Control-Prototyping (RCP) technology to validate novel innovative heating concepts for tumble dryers. Evaluation different concepts and the integration into home appliance processes is a formidable challenge, accepted in this paper. The RCP technology enables to test first component setups of heating systems, which are controlled by the simulation model of the controller. To set up the Rapid-Control-Prototyping scenario, a testing bench is built up, including equally the software-environment. The controller models are elaborated and simulated within the MathWorks® environment, in detail Simulink®/Stateflow®. This model contains the logical procedure and several safety aspects of a drying process. The simulation model is subsequent integrated into the software environment of National Instruments, to connect the virtual controller with existing and prototypical hardware components of a prototypically heat pump dryer. Within the test bench and the software periphery, the integration of the approach into the development process of Miele is described in this work. © 2018 The Authors Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB 3D printers, especially in the implementation of innovative extrusion processes which do not have a long history of development, are often built by adapting mechanical designs, drives and controls previously developed for generic machine tools. This is done through a process of choice and integration which is based principally on empirical criteria and taking into account separately the different aspects and parameters. Hereafter, we present an integrated mechatronic approach which has been adopted to design from the scratch a machine to implement the innovative metal injection moulding (MIM) technology. Its extrusion rate involves the adaptation of the generated trajectories and consequently requires "ad hoc" designs, drives and numerical controls (NC) to enable non standard acceleration (and hence torque) setpoint curves. Overall, the project resulted in an acceptable workspace volume (depending on the number of degrees of freedom of the platform) and allows one to combine the extruder flow rate, the given accuracy and the required working speed (1 m/s). The system is currently used as a test bench for exploring and optimizing the parameter space of a new MIM process. © 2017 by the authors.

AB In recent years, smart materials have proven to represent an effective means for developing a novel generation of miniaturized electro-mechanical transducers. Thanks to their many features such as high energy density and efficiency, low power requirement, low cost, scalability, and high compactness, smart material can help improving the performance of several mechatronics systems, ranging from industrial applications to biomedical and bio-inspired ones. A wide spectrum of different smart materials, each one having unique features and limitations, is currently available. This paper aims at presenting three specific types of smart materials which have shown to be particularly suitable for micropositioning applications, i.e., shape memory alloys, magnetic shape memory alloys, and dielectric elastomers. These materials exhibits complementary characteristics in terms of stress, strain, and bandwidth which make them particularly suitable for different applications. In this paper, these three smart materials are discussed in details, and major features, challenges, and applications are highlighted. © 2017 IEEE.

AB Restoring locomotion functionality of transfemoral amputees is essential for early rehabilitation treatment and for preserving mobility and independence in daily life. Research in wearable robotics fostered the development of innovative active mechatronic lowerlimb prostheses designed with the goal to reduce the cognitive and physical effort of lower-limb amputees in rehabilitation and daily life activities. To ensure benefits to the users, active mechatronic prostheses are expected to be aware of the user intention and properly interact in a closed humanintheloop paradigm. In the state of the art various cognitive interfaces have been proposed to online decode the user's intention. Electromyography in combination with mechanical sensing such as inertial or pressure sensors is a widely adopted solution for driving active mechatronic prostheses. In this framework, researchers also explored targeted muscles reinnervation for an objectiveoriented surgical amputation promoting wider usability of active prostheses. However, information kept by the neural component of the cognitive interface deteriorates in a prolonged use scenario due to electrodesrelated issues, thereby undermining the correct functionality of the active prosthesis. The objective of this work is to present a novel controller for an active transfemoral prosthesis based on whole body awareness relying on a wireless distributed noninvasive sensory apparatus acting as cognitive interface. A finitestate machine controller based on signals monitored from the wearable interface performs subjectindependent intention detection of functional tasks such as ground level walking, stair ascent, and sittostand maneuvres and their main subphases. Experimental activities carried out with four transfemoral amputees (among them one dysvascular) demonstrated high reliability of the controller capable of providing 100% accuracy rate in treadmill walking even for weak subjects and low walking speeds. The minimum success rate was of 94.8% in performing sittostand tasks. All the participants showed high confidence in using the transfemoral active prosthesis even without training period thanks to intuitiveness of the whole body awareness controller.

AB Mechatronic systems are inherently complex as they are multidisciplinary, integrating both hardware (electronical, mechanical) and software components. A huge effort is needed in the early design stages to take into account the requirements and constraints of the different stakeholders. A system model is needed to facilitate the communication between the collaborators from different domains. These efforts may be considered as a time loss by several companies. However, when a system model is available (i.e. electrical actuator for aircraft industry), it seems obvious that designing a new variant of the system with a modification of a set of requirements requires much less human effort, as it profits from the reuse and change of the already existing models of the previous system. In this paper, we propose to show the usefulness of the capitalization and reuse of system models by showing how a SysML model of an E-Taxiing (Electric Taxiing) aircraft system can be reused in order to design a new innovative HEPS (Hybrid Electric Propulsion System). © 2017 IEEE.

AB This chapter summarizes the KHS development journey to give some insights that might mean to step away from product evolution toward disruptive innovations and that aspects have to be considered to come to a full system solution. The KHS machine concept has been determined by many factors and their interactions. The chapter describes machine concept with its multiple colour or process carousels together with the modular segment structure and the new and innovative bottle carrier concept are finally resulting in a large, accurate mechatronic machine of several meters length. It explains the KHS printing machine is built of different colour modules and is designed for printing onto PET bottles. The ink and the print process had to be designed to form a decorated PET bottle, which was usable for food applications and that can be recycled into food grade material after usage. Most technology-oriented companies are dealing with "Industry 4.0" or the fourth industrial revolution. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. All rights reserved.

AB An online and real-time Condition Prediction system, so-called lifetime monitoring system, was developed at the Institute for Mechatronic Systems in Mechanical Engineering (IMS) of the TU Darmstadt, which is intended for implementation in standard control units of series production cars. Without additional hardware and only based on sensors and signals already available in a standard car, the lifetime monitoring system aims at recording the load/usage profiles of transmission components in aggregated form and at estimating continuously their remaining useful life. For this purpose, the dynamic transmission input and output torques are acquired realistically through sensor fusion. In a further step, the lifetime monitoring system is used as an input-module for the introduction of innovative procedures to more load appropriate dimensioning, cost-efficient lightweight design, failure-free operation and predictive maintenance of transmissions. This is based on damage-oriented operating strategies (so-called eLIFE) and a paradigm shift in the design philosophy relying on a smart big data approach (so-called ecoLIFE3 design procedure). The paper will present the lifetime monitoring system by the example of two concrete application cases, namely a manual and a dual clutch transmission (DCT). Furthermore, the concepts of eLIFE and ecoLIFE3 will be introduced and the economic and ecologic potentials of the approach will be discussed and quantified on basis of a DCT. © 2017 SAE International.

AB Many mechatronic devices exist to facilitate hand rehabilitation, however few directly address deficits in muscle activation patterns while also enabling functional task practice. We developed an innovative voice and electromyography-driven actuated (VAEDA) glove, which is sufficiently flexible/portable for incorporation into hand-focused therapy post-stroke. The therapeutic benefits of this device were examined in a longitudinal intervention study. Twenty-two participants with chronic, moderate hand impairment [Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment Stage of Hand (CMSA-H = 4)] enrolled > 8 months post-stroke for 18 1-h training sessions ( 3\,\times week) employing a novel hand-focused occupational therapy paradigm, either with (VAEDA) or without (No-VAEDA) actuated assistance. Outcome measures included CMSA-H, Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Action Research Arm Test, Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Assessment (FMUE), grip and pinch strength and hand kinematics. All outcomes were recorded at baseline and endpoint (immediately after and four weeks post-training). Significant improvement was observed following training for some measures for the VAEDA group (n = 11) but for none of the measures for the No-VAEDA group (n = 11). Specifically, statistically significant gains were observed for CMSA-H (p = 0.038) and WMFT (p = 0.012) as well as maximum digit aperture subset (p = 0.003, n = 7), but not for the FMUE or grip or pinch strengths. In conclusion, therapy effectiveness appeared to be increased by employment of the VAEDA glove, which directly targets deficits in muscle activation patterns. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB The plasma based copper coating process is an innovative process for the production of planar or three dimensional circuit carriers. Both conductor lines for logic circuits and conductors for high power transmissions can be realized. This paper describes the manufacturing process chain of direct metallization by plasma based copper coating and shows the potentials of this technology. Circuits can be applied to almost any base substrate such as polymers, ceramics or even metal since an insulating dielectric lacquer layer separates the substrate from the metallization. In contrast to previous plasma based copper depositing processes the digital direct metallization enables clearly defined fine structures without using any inflexible and high-maintenance masks [1]. An enormous advantage of this procedure is the complete elimination of wet chemical process steps, which are known from the laser direct structuring method (LDS) [2]. In addition to diverse characterizations this paper represents the opportunities of the technology by means of demonstrator applications. © 2016 IEEE.

AB Decreasing cost for computing power, connectivity and electronics arouse potential for a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) applications but the development of value-adding IoT applications evolves still relatively slowly. To foster their realisation, IoT application development must be approached holistically. The identification of development challenges is a necessary groundwork for a holistic design methodology. This paper presents the development of an IoT application based on an existing mechatronic product as case study and derives challenges faced by developers with an engineering design background. An IoT add-on device is integrated into a mechatronic system. The use of actuators can be monitored in real-time. The identified challenges relate to the identification of added value, making of design decisions, understanding the target physical object, keeping iteration cycles equally short and learning of new skills. The identified challenges inhibit the realisation of IoT applications and must be addressed to foster IoT applications in industry. In future, methods to identify value-adding IoT applications and tools to efficiently realise such applications must be developed.

AB The complexity in all products and processes increases and the need for operative agility is seen as a key factor of success (Link and Lewirck, 2014). Agile approaches are extremely beneficial for situations with high uncertainty and a continuously changing environment. During the exploration new insights are gathered and an abstract vision becomes a concrete product idea. Based on testing and user feedback the feature set is adapted. The guiding principles are the interdisciplinarity and the strong design orientation. Rapid implementation of ideas into objects ("manifestation") triggers internal and external communication and feedback mechanisms. The prototype is seen as a process-and phase-spanning driver of the innovation process. However to date, there is no clear understanding of how an agile development actually looks like in the field of mechatronics and what the role of prototyping is in this context. Thus, the goal of this explorative study is to evaluate how prototyping is related to a mechatronic project path with regards to agile development. To this end, a prototyping roadmap is used to derive an agile mechatronic product development.

This equipment is designed under the principles of an integrated mechatronic device and is particularly useful for the intervention teams that have to respond to chemical and ecological incidents (accidents or terrorist attacks), as well as to the decision factors because it provides them, in a very short time, the necessary information to take urgent and informed action for the neutralization of the local factors generating the crisis (chemical war agents, toxic industrial compounds, explosives, drugs, etc.), for the protection of the personnel and the environment, for choosing the appropriate decontamination means and medical treatment. [1,2,3,4]. Taking into account the fact that in this type of interventions ‘time’ is very important, this system is necessary. The mechatronic equipment has been designed to process, in a short time, all kinds of samples (solid, liquid, gases or complex substances’ amalgams), integrating a number of preparation techniques

AB Recent innovations have focused on the development of products which have embedded features such as sustainable energy power sources and intelligent controls which take into account energy efficiency and environmental variables that drive the total cost of the product ownership. The primary purpose of such efforts is to promote products that are more energy efficient and that are making smaller environmental footprint during their lifecycle. Lower cost, easy assembly and better manufacturability are some of the parameters that are part of the Design for Excellence (DfX) methodology. One of the most significant expenses that customers will face will occur during the use stage of the product lifecycle. This paper discusses the application of Design for Use (DfU) strategies on a conceptual design and prototype of a solar skimmer for a swimming pool. A group of senior students in mechanical engineering technology program completed this project as their requirement for graduation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB Stress and strain measurements on frames and structures are mainly conducted by the use of strain gauges. A measuring chain applied in such measurements usually consists of strain gauges, amplifiers and data acquisition and logging device. The applicability of such instrumentation mainly depends on its sensitivity measuring repeatability, accuracy and noiseless operation. The key point of this paper is harmonization of measuring properties for the newly invented deformeter with the measuring electronics. Much alike a standard modeling of Mechatronic items, a very specific CLD (Close Loop Deformeter) is optimized throughout coupled modeling, bridging analysis of 3D virtual model and real design of laboratory prototype. Virtual experiment was developed to correspond with actual measurements on the test rig. The idea of rectification factor is introduced into concept of 3D modelling with an innovative CLD research. The focus of the research was kept on the output linearity, measuring range and resolution of the invented deformeter. © 2017, Strojarski Facultet. All rights reserved.

AB Humans and other animals have a strong propensity to explore the environment. When human infants, as well as other primates, face the opportunity to interact with the environment by manipulating objects, they may discover and learn the contingency between one action and its outcome. Thus, manipulation, as a form of spontaneous exploration, has a great biological significance, since it allows to discover and learn the relationship between action and effect, enabling humans and other animals to plan goal-directed tasks. How do the specific characteristics of the primate’s body influence this process? With its large amount of degrees of freedom, sensors, and nervous terminations, the hand is the main interface with the external world, and it profoundly influences the primates’ interaction with the environment. How does object exploration mediated by manual actions affect the acquisition of problem-solving abilities? To try to answer this question, we experimentally compared how children and capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.)—nonhuman primates well known for their manual dexterity and for being curious and highly manipulative—acquire new cause–effect relations through spontaneous manual exploration of a new environment. The experiments were carried out with the mechatronic board, an innovative device specifically designed to allow interspecies comparative research. The board allowed testing whether spontaneous manipulation of objects (not instrumental to achieve any specific goal) improved subjects’ ability to solve a subsequent goal-directed task by retrieving the knowledge learned during previous exploration. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB Innovative footwear addressed to aged 60+ users is aimed at combining functional values of the materials used with the function of a “smart” product, where modern mechatronic technologies were used. All materials and elements of footwear are to meet such criteria as comfort and safety of use and the use of materials that do not contain chemicals harmful to humans. The design of the innovative 60+ footwear need to meet the expectations of customers in terms of hygiene and health, as well as fit to the foot and aesthetics. Having this in mind, we first carried out a thorough analysis of the physico-mechanical and chemical properties of materials selected for various elements of 60+ footwear (uppers, bottoms).

AB This paper describes an innovative engineering design of a first-year engineering course. The course is offered in the second semester of the academic year to students of different engineering disciplines such as mechanical, mechatronic, electrical, electronics, civil, environmental and manufacturing. The course incorporates a mix of techniques to help students better engage with the subject matter and with one another. A major part of the new course is the practical assessment component requiring students to apply physical, mathematical, mechanical and electrical concepts to real life engineering design problems. Three different engineering design modules were developed. Each module consists of an authentic engineering design problem which has been specially constructed in order to provide students with the opportunity to apply the basic engineering, maths and physics concepts they acquired during the first semester. Depending on the students intended engineering major, they choose one of the three engineering design modules. In order to best prepare students for the design project, they firstly do two small group assignment tasks on a particular engineering problem. This serves as the preparatory work for the engineering design module. The assignments are done in class time so as to promote full collaboration between students and instructors and to encourage the exchange of knowledge and ideas. The course aims to better equip students with workforce skills in problem solving and effective oral and written communication. © SAGE Publications.

AB The detection of human balance functional disorders may provide some kind of awareness or even warning about potential problems for human health both in organs responsible for ensuring the balance function and in organs related to fulfilment of other important life functions. Modern world offers some sophisticated solutions which enable not only determination of the human balance functional capacity but also offer some kind of training environment to provide corresponding rehabilitation. Unfortunately, such systems are very expensive. And this make limitations of their accessibility and practical usability for a wide range of the target group/population. Software solutions, including mobile applications, on the other hand, are incomparably cheaper. However, they do not allow to make precise balance capability measurements, limiting to simplified balance retention simulators. During implementation of the Latvian National State Research Program VPP INOSOCTEREHI from 2015 to 2017 three human balance capability testing prototypes were developed using a variety of electronic and mechatronic solutions. The last one was successfully approbated during two pilots in Latvian schools in 2016 and demonstrated at the International Invention and Innovation Exhibition MINOX-2016. This paper analyses benefits and disadvantages of approaches used in creating of these prototypes. Besides, authors make initial comparison of developed third prototype version against the BioSway system offered in the market. The paper gives also insight into particular system interface development and new effective graphic portrayal of the balance testing output data, as well as sets the goals for further possible commercialization of the developed balance testing prototype. © Rezekne Academy of Technologies, Rezekne 2017.

AB The use of certain agricultural machines equipped with parts driven by the power take off (p.t.o.), exposes the operators to the risk of catching and dragging, with dire consequences in case of accidents, which in most cases result in fatal injuries. Especially the round balers, chippers and the manure spreaders does not have, to date, effective ways to reduce these specific risks. The solutions available on the machine are numerous, but not resolutive and focused on the systems that are exclusively effective to protect the machine kinematic chain by any breakages. Infact, the torque levels reached for the actuation, are significantly higher than those needed to harm operators. In previous experiments, the research unit of the Florence University, had studied effective systems for decoupling of the transmission. These studies showed that to make effective a decoupler device was necessary to have an active safety, namely to ensure in rest conditions the transmission interruption. For these reasons, within the Promosic project, the Research Unit of Florence (UR-UniFi) based on their experiences, the device, represented by the electromagnetic clutch, has employed, as the only system capable of offering an active safety, replacing, however, the inefficient control system with two types of innovative sensors, which monitors the human presence, through detection of respiratory activity, or body temperature. The innovative aspect of this research is the implementation of a control device coupled to the electromagnetic clutch. An infrared device, with laboratory tests performed, was effectively applied on round balers and shredders machines. The tests performed by interposing the human limbs inside the sensor monitoring field, showed response times of 50 ns to 0.4 m distance. The results have shown the high potential of the developed system for transmission decoupling. Furthermore, its cheapness, makes it a feasible solution for every the agricultural machinery manufacturers to meet the requirements imposed by current safety regulation.

AB Vehicle handling and stability performances are of great importance high performance sport cars. To reach these targets, very high standards of performance all the more prestigious vehicle companies have improved a lot the kinematics and compliance of the front and rear suspensions, together with the tire characteristics development. Normally the improvements have been obtained working on existing suspensions without adding any active systems able to change the suspension kinematics and compliances. The only exception has been some suspension rework of 4 wheel steering system studied in the early 80ies years, that is an active system able to change the toe angle of the rear suspension wheels. This solution has not obtained a significant success also in the market of very prestigious cars because could not reach the target performance improvement of driving requested by the customer. The proposed research work is innovative because instead to change actively the wheel toe angle it applies a solution to change the wheel camber angle through the geometry of the rear suspension. The proposed system uses two separated electro mechanical actuators, one per wheel, in place of two existing rear suspension links. A Sensor Signal Processing Model has been developed to estimate the vehicle states and calculating tire-road contact forces and vehicle sideslip angle. The methodological approach uses the equations of motion of the chassis applying the fundamental principles of classical physics

AB Hybridization of automotive powertrains by using more than one type of energy converter is considered as an important step towards reducing fuel consumption and air pollutants. Specifically, the development of energy efficient, highly complex, alternative drive-train systems, in which the interactions of different energy converters play an important role, requires new design methods and processes. This paper discusses the inclusion of an alternative hybrid power train into an existing vehicle platform for maximum energy efficiency. The new proposed integrated Vehicle Hardware In-the-loop (VHiL) and Model Based Design (MBD) approach is utilized to evaluate the energy efficiency of electrified powertrain. In VHiL, a complete chassis system becomes an integrated part of the vehicle test bed. A complete conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) powered vehicle is tested in roller bench test for the integration of energy efficient hybrid electric power train modules in closed-loop, real-time, feedback configuration. A model that is a replica of the test vehicle is executed – in real-time- where all hybrid power train modules are included. While the VHiL platform is controlling the signal exchange between the test bed automation software and the vehicle on-board controller, the road load exerted on the driving wheels is manipulated in closed –loop real-time manner in order to reflect all hybrid driving modes including

AB This paper presents the mechatronic system design and development of a four-wheel drive/steer (4WD4S) mobile robot as a non-holonomic omnidirectional robot, MARIO—Mobile Autonomous Robot for Intelligent Operations. An innovative integrated application of CAD/CAM/CAE and RP has been employed for rapid development of the robot chassis and other mechanical parts by using different software tools. Most of the parts were designed by 3D CAD software which allows further CAE analysis including structural and motion analysis. To reduce the manufacturing time and cost, CAM and RP have been used to manufacture the main parts. These master parts are manufactured by workshop machining and 3D printing. Robot Operating System (ROS) alongside Gazebo simulator have been utilized for modelling, simulation, software development and visualization which enabled to develop the optimum embedded system to control the robot. With this integrated approach, a prototype of MARIO has been developed with a reasonably low manufacturing cost and time. © 2016 The Author(s).

The shared control approach is one of the most emergent procedures that can compensate and optimally couple human smartness with the high precision and productivity characteristic to mechatronic systems. To explore and to exploit this approach in the industrial field, an innovative shared control algorithm was elaborated, designed and validated in a specific case study. © SAGE Publications Ltd, unless otherwise noted.

AB The reconfigurability feature represents an instrumental characteristic for manufacturing systems that are required to frequently adapt the architecture and functionalities to match evolving production environment where changes of product variants and demand volumes frequently occur. Transportation systems embrace a major industrial application of the reconfiguration concept. Reconfigurable transportation systems (RTSs) are conceived as multiple independent modules to implement alternative inbound logistic systems’ configurations. Together with mechatronic interfaces and distributed control solutions, the full exploitation of reconfigurability strategies for transportation systems relies upon flexible production management policies. This enables the dynamic computation of part routings in RTSs after every reconfiguration and change in the way transportation modules are exploited. The current work proposes an innovative agent-based algorithm that combines global and local optimisation criteria to manage the part flow in RTS. The proposed approach is designed as fully distributed across transportation modules; based on current RTS’ topology and status, it ensures the autonomy in selecting routing decisions while embracing global and local evolving optimisation strategies. The benefits of the approach have been investigated with reference to a set of realistic RTS topologies exhibiting different routing options, in order to assess the algorithm under different part-routing conditions. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB The design of a flywheel system for energy storage is herein performed through the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) as an example of mechatronic product development and innovation. Some relevant advantages of the MBSE applied to a material mechatronic system, in some activities, as the requirement analysis, the identification of system capabilities, the definition of architecture and the system validation are identified. Moreover, the paper is aimed at investigating some critical issues arising when the MBSE tools are applied to machine design, being still a domain poorly inclined to exploit this holistic approach. That trend might be related to technical difficulties in assessing an interoperable framework of simulators aimed at dealing simultaneously with functional and physical models. In addition the technology scouting looks poorly connected within the standard SysML diagrams, without introducing some additional charts. A demonstration of the fruitful impact of the MBSE on the machine design is herein proposed, to show some advantages provided as a mechatronic integrated system is conceived and how a complete trade-off analysis could be supported by the MBSE modeling activity. © 2016 IEEE.

AB This paper presents the design of an innovative device that applies dynamic mechanical load to human knee joints. Dynamic loading is employed by applying cyclic and periodic force on a target area. The repeated force loading was considered to be an effective modality for repair and rehabilitation of long bones that are subject to ailments like fractures, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, etc. The proposed device design builds on the knowledge gained in previous animal and mechanical studies. It employs a modified slider-crank linkage mechanism actuated by a brushless Direct Current (DC) motor and provides uniform and cyclic force. The functionality of the device was simulated in a software environment and the structural integrity was analyzed using a finite element method for the prototype construction. The device is controlled by a microcontroller that is programmed to provide the desired loading force at a predetermined frequency and for a specific duration. The device was successfully tested in various experiments for its usability and full functionality. The results reveal that the device works according to the requirements of force magnitude and operational frequency. This device is considered ready to be used for a clinical study to examine whether controlled knee-loading could be an effective regimen for treating the stated bone-related ailments. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB Digital Direct Metallization (DDM) is an innovative process for the production of planar or three dimensional circuit carriers. Both conductor lines for logic circuits and conductors for high power transmissions can be realized. This paper describes the manufacturing process chain of Digital Direct Metallization by plasma based copper coating and shows the potentials of this technology. Circuits can be applied to almost any base substrate such as polymers, ceramics or even metal since an insulating dielectric lacquer layer separates the substrate from the metallization. In contrast to previous plasma based copper depositing processes the Digital Direct Metallization enables clearly defined fine structures without using any inflexible and high-maintenance masks [1]. An enormous advantage of this procedure is the complete elimination of wet chemical process steps, which are known from the laser direct structuring method (LDS) [2]. In addition to diverse mechanical and electrical characterizations this paper represents the opportunities of the technology by means of a demonstrator application. © 2016 IEEE.

AB The shift from the information society to the knowledge based society caused by the mechatronic revolution, that took place in the 9th decade of the last century, launched a lot of challenges for education and researches activities too. Knowledge production development asks for new educational technologies to stimulate the initiative and creativity as a base to increase the productivity in the knowledge production. The paper presents details related on the innovative potential of mechatronics as educational environment for transdisciplinarity learning and integral education. The basic infrastructure of that environment is based on mechatronic platforms. In order to develop the knowledge production at the national level the specific structures are to be developed. The paper presents details related on the structure of the National Mechatronic Platform as a true knowledge factory. The benefits of the effort to develop the specific infrastructure for knowledge production in the field of mechatronics are outlined too. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB This paper proposes an innovative mechatronic piezo-actuated module to control vibrations in modern machine tools. Vibrations represent one of the main issues that seriously compromise the quality of the workpiece. The active vibration control (AVC) device is composed of a host part integrated with sensors and actuators synchronized by a regulator; it is able to make a self-assessment and adjust to alterations in the environment. In particular, an innovative smart actuator has been designed and developed to satisfy machining requirements during active vibration control. This study presents the mechatronic model based on the kinematic and dynamic analysis of the AVC device. To ensure a real time performance, a H2-LQG controller has been developed and validated by simulations involving a machine tool, PZT actuator and controller models. The Hardware in the Loop (HIL) architecture is adopted to control and attenuate the vibrations. A set of experimental tests has been performed to validate the AVC module on a commercial machine tool. The feasibility of the real time vibration damping is demonstrated and the simulation accuracy is evaluated. © 2016 by the authors.

AB A concept of mechatronic system for traffic measurements based on the piezoelectric transducers used as sensors is presented. The aim of the work project is to theoretically and experimentally analyse the dynamic response of road infrastructure forced by vehicles motion. The subject of the project is therefore on the borderline of civil engineering and mechanical and covers a wide range of issues in both these areas. To measure the dynamic response of the tested pieces of road infrastructure application of piezoelectric, in particular piezoelectric transducers in the form of piezoelectric films (MFC - Macro Fiber Composite) is proposed. The purpose is to verify the possibility to use composite piezoelectric transducers as sensors used in traffic surveillance systems - innovative methods of controlling the road infrastructure and traffic. Presented paper reports works that were done in order to receive the basic information about analysed systems and their behaviour under excitation by passing vehicles. It is very important to verify if such kind of systems can be controlled by the analysis of the dynamic response of road infrastructure measured using piezoelectric transducers. Obtained results show that it could be possible. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB On November 2, 2001, the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage provided a detailed state cooperation system and set out the basic principles for the protection of underwater cultural heritage. To date, the Convention has been ratified by 51 countries. One of the four main principles states that the in situ preservation of underwater cultural heritage should be considered as the first option before allowing or engaging in any further activities. In accordance with these principles and recommendations, in the last years many projects intended for developing and testing new techniques and tools to support in situ conservation of underwater archaeological remains have been funded and are now underway. This paper describes the contribution of the CoMAS project (In situ conservation planning of Underwater Archaeological Artifacts—http://www.comasproject.eu), funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) and run by a partnership of private companies and public research centers. The CoMAS project aims at the development of new materials, techniques, and tools for the documentation, conservation, and restoration of underwater archaeological sites in their natural environment. The paper describes in detail the results achieved during the project in the development of innovative materials, mechatronic tools, and armed remotely operated vehicle systems that can efficiently support the restorers’ work in all their activities for preserving underwater cultural heritage in its original location on the seafloor. © 2016, Marine Technology Society Journal.

AB The exhaust emissions legislation for motor vehicles with combustion engines is complicating the manufacturing of environmental yet powerful engines more than ever before. Common approaches towards solving this problem from manufacturer side are downsizing, hybridization and the development of electric drives. The subject of this project is the development of an innovative mechatronic control unit as replacement for the camshaft driven valve train of common combustion engines. The systems aim is a contribution to the progression of the development of modern combustion engines satisfying current demands in terms of economy and efficiency. To accomplish this aim, the Full Variable Valve Train (FVVT) utilizes an indirectly controlled servo valve, controlling the position of the engine valves fully independently. The advantage of the indirect system control is an enhanced robustness against interference influences. Further, the physical dimensions of the system become smaller, which is a prerequisite in order to implement the system into conventional combustion engines. This paper outlines the basic principles of the system introducing all required components, followed by the layout of the indirectly controlled mechatronic engine valve controller using mathematical fundamentals and fluid mechanics. © 2016 IEEE.

AB A team was formed from students across campus including majors from business entrepreneurship, management, marketing, and electrical, civil, mechanical, and mechatronic engineering to compete in the U.S. Department of Energy Collegiate Wind Competition 2016. Requirements of the competition are to deliver a market-driven technology application, create an innovative business plan, and develop a deployment strategy. Two faculty advisers, a mechanical engineering assistant professor from the college of engineering and an entrepreneurship assistant professor from the college of business designed and delivered content to help student members effectively collaborate and innovate across their disciplines and form a cohesive and high functioning team. In addition to being members of the cross-disciplinary team, half the students were concurrently enrolled in a business management course with an emphasis in social entrepreneurship and market analysis while another half were enrolled in a senior capstone engineering course. Activities in the form of workshops were delivered to the team during weekly meetings to develop and enhance skills in team development, communications, project management, business development, brainstorming, and ideation. In addition, engineering students collaborated with business students during the business management course to provide technical expertise during market research and analysis and students presented to one another on topics related to their particular disciplines. This paper describes the workshops that were delivered, student reflections and feedback, and lessons learned throughout the experience based on faculty observations and student performance. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB This paper describes an implementation of a model-based methodology to validate an innovative Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) scheme applied to a mechatronic modular structure for a packaging machine. This new HIL environment is implemented by means of a unique CPU and allows use of an ordinary personal computer for the HIL simulation of a module of the packaging machine, without any other hardware tool. The research includes identification of modular building blocks through a suitable model-based systems design, with SysML models, Simulink models, and Beckhoff TwinCAT software. The novel HIL scheme is presented accompanied by experimental results of a composite module, which consists of four sub-modules. © 2016 IEEE.

AB In this paper, universality of the mechatronic approach is confirmed with the examples of highly specialized and innovative systems, recently developed for a very specific applications. As shown, similar design steps, tools and testing procedures may lead to effective solutions even for distant and challenging research areas. First, an Ultralight Mobile Drilling System, dedicated to extraction of soil and rock probes from subsurface regions, is presented. For this case, minimization of mass and high mobility of the system, whilst maintaining performance of bigger drilling rigs, required during operation in space environment, is taken into account. The presented design consists of a four-wheeled rover with adjustable rocker mechanism, a multifunctional core drilling module and a support module with manipulation capabilities and dedicated sample storage. Second, entire design process for fully scalable and reconfigurable data-based system for monitoring of technical condition for mechanical constructions is introduced. The system is based on the measurements of electromechanical impedance, which are carried out with piezoelectric transducers. Both presented systems successfully passed the laboratory and industrial tests and, therefore, confirmed correctness of the choices made with the applied design procedures. All aspects of the mechatronic approach were investigated to construct fully functional prototypes designed for different tasks and to deal with different environmental conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ATHENIS-3D FP7 EU project aims at providing new enabling technologies (analog, digital and power components) for high-voltage and high-temperature applications, tested for power systems of new hybrid/electrical vehicles. Innovation is exploited at process/device level (3D chip stacking, wafer level packaging, trench capacitors and TSV-inductors integrated in the interposer, high-reliable non-volatile Magnetic RAM), circuit-level (inductorless high-voltage DC-DC converter, high-temperature 28nm System-on-Chip platform) and system-level (compact 3D embedded power mechatronic system). Enabling high integration levels of complex systems, operating in harsh environments, in a single packaged 3D device, ATHENIS-3D allows for one order of magnitude area reduction vs. today PCB-based power and control systems. Integration costs will be consequently reduced in key industrial sectors for Europe where high-voltage/temperature operations are mandatory (vehicles, avionics, space/defense, industrial automation, energy). © 2016 EDAA.

AU ABSTRACT: In the industry for highly specialized machine building (small series with high variety and high complexity) and in healthcare a demand for adaptive robotics is rapidly coming up. Technically skilled people are not always available in sufficient numbers. A lot of know how with respect to the required technologies is available but successful adaptive robotic system designs are still rare. In our research at the university of applied sciences we incorporate new available technologies in our education courses by way of research projects; in these projects students will investigate the application possibilities of new technologies together with companies and teachers. Thus we are able to transfer knowledge to the students including an innovation oriented attitude and skills. Last years we developed several industrial binpicking applications for logistics and machining-factories with different types of 3D vision. Also force feedback gripping has been developed including slip sensing. Especially for healthcare robotics we developed a so-called twisted wire actuator, which is very compact in combination with an underactuated gripper
   manufactured in one piece in polyurethane. We work both on modeling and testing the functions of these designs but we work also on complete demonstrator systems. Since the amount of disciplines involved in complex product and machine design increases rapidly we pay a lot of attention with respect to systems engineering methods. Apart from the classical engineering disciplines like mechanical, electrical
   software and mechatronics engineering, especially for adaptive robotics more and more disciplines like industrial product design
   communication &multimedia design and of course physics and even art are to be involved depending on the specific application to be designed. Design tools like Vmodel, agile/scrum and design-approaches to obtain the best set of requirements are being implemented in the engineering studies from the early beginning. © Owned by the authors

AB The EUFRIN Working Group on "Fruit chemical thinning" started its activity in 1994 and since then regularly met every year to compare the results obtained in fruit thinning trials performed in different European countries. Nowadays more than 20 countries, most of them represented by researchers from European Institutions, form the WG. Exclusively researchers originally formed the WG, but now chemical company representatives, involved in the development and marketing of fruit thinning agents, are part of the Working Group. The WG researchers have a different and recognized expertize on fruit thinning and their activity faced on practical, physiological and molecular biology aspects of the abscission phenomenon to exploit and better understand the thinners mechanism of action to have robust information to be translated in the practice for commercial application. Moreover, the WG activity carried out in these years chemical thinning trials with the most recent molecules, as well as other alternative method to the hand thinning like the mechanical and other innovative method, such the "mechatronic" one. © 2016, International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB Ongoing advances in mechatronic components and power electronics help to improve control systems within automotive applications. New developed or designed components enable more efficient system architectures and control. Based on these development trends, mechatronic systems within automotive engineering are gaining more and more importance. At the same time, quality and safety requirements become challenging for automotive manufacturers as well as their suppliers regarding the decrease of default risk and increase of component reliability in a high degree. To fulfil nowadays safety standards for complex mechatronic systems, several different analysis methods have to be applied. Only the connection of any safe fault recognition with a safe fault reaction enables a system to avoid harmful consequences. The increasing amount of electronic components in safety related environments creates a need for smart architectures and methods that can compensate single failures of its components. In all cases a reliability analysis method is in charge to identify and assess safety related systems as proposed by the ISO 26262. Systems or components which are evaluated with an ASIL A or higher are legitimate candidates for fail-operational architectures. Regarding product development, there is an ongoing change from routine tests (durability tests) to testing selected parts of a safety function (fault injection tests). How action is taken is changing, with a trend towards a further development of software tools, supporting functional safe systems holistically, including hazard and risk assessment, integrated system analysis of systematic and random failures, and hardware metrics. Safety-relevant aspects in the development of modern mechatronic systems have to be considered thoroughly. The high number of technical properties and complex connections of mechatronics systems in the development of modern vehicles are very challenging for state-of-the-art analysis methods. For this reason, new and innovational safety concepts are required, to optimize existing safety concepts using conventional components and methods in combination. © 2016, FISITA.

AB The evolution process for creatures is very, very long, and contains many useful secrets and rationality mostly hidden in their structure, motion and configuration. Biomimetic mechatronic design is a useful approach for future mechatronic innovation, which can significantly enhance the performance of mechatronic systems. As an important issue for biomimetic mechatronic design, it is necessary to make a robot as soft as a natural creature to achieve more efficient, high-performance and creature-like motions. Compared to a conventional rigid robot, the design and control of a soft robot is difficult because the coupling between the flexible structure and surrounding environment should be considered, which is very difficult to resolve due to the large deformations and complicated and coupled dynamics. This is the main reason why design methods for soft robots has not been established, despite the many trial developments of soft robots that have been undertaken to date. The challenges for the design of biomimetic soft underwater robots based on numerical simulation considering the coupling between the flexible structure and surrounding fluid as well as control technologies are described in this chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB This paper presents an effective application of Jerk to plan trajectory and control undesirable effects (e.g. patient’s hesitations and tremors) in active rehabilitation training using some mechatronic devices. Jerk is the time derivative of acceleration, and it is associated to the rapidly changing of forces. It is more sensible than other parameters (e.g. speed or acceleration) to intercept undesirable conditions as the patient’s tremors or sub-movements. This study proposes an innovative regulator system based on Minimum Jerk trajectory planning and formulation. The trajectory planning strategy of limb rehabilitation is described considering the clinical therapy requirements and patients’ needs. A case study based on a path shape that simulates a point-to-point motion is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The study presents the kinematic analysis of the mechatronic device and the formulation of the objective function to minimize Jerk along the trajectory. A controller was developed to attenuate the micro sub-movements that recreated the patient hesitations. A set of simulations of the mechatronic model was performed highlighting the reduction of the jerk peak magnitude and the deviation from pre-determined trajectory when the controller was activated, improving the rehabilitation training. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

AB The exhaust emissions legislation for motor vehicles with combustion engines is complicating the manufacturing of environmental yet powerful engines more than ever before. Common approaches of this problem from manufacturer side are downsizing, hybridization and the development of electric drives. The subject of this project is the development of an innovative mechatronic control unit as replacement for the camshaft driven valve train of common combustion engines. The system's aim is a contribution to the progression of the development of modern combustion engines satisfying current demands in terms of economy and efficiency. Before this complex mechatronic ”Full Variable Valve Train” (FVVT) system was manufactured, rapid prototyping was utilized to generate a prototype of the overall system, which proved to be an advantage as the system design could be evaluated and fault finding simplified (rapid prototyping in this case refers to the manufacturing of hardware components). The technology used is the fused deposition modeling (FDM) carried out with printers by Stratasys, the company that commercialised the technology. The paper outlines the FDM technology, takes a closer look at the influence of the printing direction on the parts’ accuracy and shows the obtained research results with the mechatronic engine valve controller. © 2016

AB This paper focuses on the redesign of an innovative punch and bind machine. Business machines can be integrated with recent technology that enables productivity and efficiency. Integrating smart technologies in the existing traditional business machines will ease the evolution of these systems. The creation of a pilot platform is required, which enables further developments on servitization. In order to ease and increase the office document binding rate, as well as reduce the probability of errors to occur, efforts were made to develop a measuring system which allows the correct measurement of the document and simultaneously specify the appropriate binding spine. Developments were made in a system that allows the inserted spine verification. In addition, a system for automated document binding, with the correct position of paper sheets was developed. The integrated platform allowing communication between all systems is presented. The new system has several advantages in both its hardware design and its underlying sensors, providing a significant improvement in performance and upgradability over existing systems. The mechatronic system combines mechanical position sensing with electronics implementation of the hardware and the basic algorithms. This solution consists in a system that allows the punch and bind optimization of a range of sheets of paper, plastic or other materials. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.

AB Innovation is the key to new technology. At the "Division of Fluid and Mechatronic Systems, Linköping University", a framework for aircraft conceptual design is continuously developed. RAPID (Robust Aircraft Parametric Interactive Design) and Tango are knowledge-based aircraft conceptual design tools implemented in CATIA® and Matlab® respectively. The work presented in this paper is a part of RAPID, explores the method, and proposes a framework for fuselage optimization with a parametric, reusable and automated windshield with a focus on the pilot visibility for conceptual design. The geometry is initially propagated from CAD (CATIA®) to CFD (Ansys®) using CADNexus. Initial optimization implemented on a 2D geometry to find an appropriate angle for the struct. An overall optimization to minimize the drag and maximize the load taken by windshield struts depending on pilot's eye position, floor height and cockpit length performed. Methodology to automatically mesh using Fine™/Open with OpenLabs and Ansys®, as the number of surfaces increases or decrease throughout the design automation is also proposed and used during the optimization.

AB Since the late 1990s, there has been a burst of research on robotic devices for poststroke rehabilitation. Robot-mediated therapy produced improvements on recovery of motor capacity; however, so far, the use of robots has not shown qualitative benefit over classical therapist-led training sessions, performed on the same quantity of movements. Multidegree-of-freedom robots, like the modern upper-limb exoskeletons, enable a distributed interaction on the whole assisted limb and can exploit a large amount of sensory feedback data, potentially providing new capabilities within standard rehabilitation sessions. Surprisingly, most publications in the field of exoskeletons focused only on mechatronic design of the devices, while little details were given to the control aspects. On the contrary, we believe a paramount aspect for robots potentiality lies on the control side. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a taxonomy of currently available control strategies for exoskeletons for neurorehabilitation, in order to formulate appropriate questions toward the development of innovative and improved control strategies. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB In recent years, the authors studied the possibility of using low frequency in-Air ultrasonic sensors in several applications of robotic interest related to the perception and the reconstruction of the external environment. They introduced several methods based on innovative mathematical tools for solving problems, such as the position detection and orientation of a mobile robot with respect to a corridor wall, the correct reconstruction of two orthogonal panels in spite of the effect of multiple reflections affecting the data in the corner zone, and the reconstruction of the boundary walls of a room environment. All the proposed innovative strategies were tested on a designed mechatronic scanning system consisting of ultrasonic sensors rotated by a servo modular actuator and also with the data from a scanning validated model. In this review, the main steps and achievements will be presented so as to summarize the research work of recent years as well as reflect on the importance of appropriate and innovative techniques regarding ultrasonic data processing. The originality of the present work concerns the possibility of disposing all the developed approaches as a whole in order to use in-Air ultrasonic sensors for robotic perception in several environmental situations. © 2016 Author(s).

AB This article is a part of the series dedicated to AI Methods Inspired by Nature and their implementation in the mechatronic systems. The CutMAG algorithmuses hybrid approach to optimisation, i.e. a combination of classic genetic algorithms (GA) with morphologic optimisation (M) thus creating innovative approach to optimisation of cutting disk design (Cut) for the multi-edge grinder. The input data include population of individuals. Each individual is represented by a set of cutting disks. Whereas the fitness function was assumed as a combination of several postulates of the mechanical design foundations. The method includes mechanical, design and energy aspects. Each individual constitutes a complete solution of the disk set whereas the population represents the entire class of solutions. The fitness function of an individual is calculated as the average fitness of each disk supplemented by information describing the relationship between both adjacent disks. The method for calculation of function values was selected so as to ensure its maximisation in the process of evolution. Although promising results of the genetic algorithms operation were achieved, one can consider further improvement of the method efficiency. The authors used morphological operations in order to better adopt the method to the task. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB In high-value manufacturing sectors, many manufacturing processes are still performed manually, such as polishing operations for small metallic parts. Increasing volume, the need for consistency in quality, and health and safety issues are some of the reasons for industry to search urgently for alternative solutions for manual polishing processes. This article reports the development of an intelligent automated polishing system to achieve consistent surface quality and removal of superficial defects from high-value components, such as those used in aerospace industry. The article reports an innovative method to capture manual polishing processes by skilled operators. The captured polishing parameters are then used to develop and control a robotic polishing system that can adopt various polishing patterns. A brief summary of existing fully and semi- Automated polishing systems and their inadequacy for industrial applications are discussed. The need for building automation system based on manual operations are explained and a systematic data capturing process for a specific aerospace-based component is defined. The development of the process capturing device is explained, the data analysis and interpretations are discussed and the migration from manual operation to an automated polishing system is reported. Further detailed information is given in relation with combining data from various sensors and building of an automated system based on learning from manual operations. The research results are also briefly discussed and conclusions are drawn regarding applicability of automated systems for highly skilled manual operations.

AB By scavenging the vibration energy from the ambience, the piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) technology provides one of the most promising solutions towards the everlasting power supplies for distributed wireless sensors. Given the capacitive characteristics of the piezoelectric devices, synchronized switch interface circuits, such as the synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI), have been developed towards the harvested power enhancement. The self-powered sensing, synchronization, and switching issues are essential for implementing these circuit innovations towards practical applications. This paper provides a comparative study on the recently proposed mechatronic self-powered SSHI (MSPSSHI) and the existing electronic self-powered SSHI (ESP-SSHI) interfaces. The MSP-SSHI uses a single-pole-doublethrow switch to simultaneously perform the sensing and switching functions. It reduces the switching threshold and energy losses caused by the semiconductors in the electronic solution, and also eliminates the high-voltage breakdown problem in MOS based ESP-SSHI. On the other hand, the distance between the pole and throws will introduce some switching phase difference under large vibrations. A piecewise linear model is built for analyzing the switching phase difference in MSP-SSHI. It was found that the damping ratio and stiffness of the mechanical switch can significantly influence the switching phase difference. Experimental result shows that the MSP-SSHI can effectively increase the harvested power under small and medium vibration levels, compared to the standard bridge rectifier; whereas, the ESP-SSHI performs better under medium and strong vibration. © 2016 SPIE.

AB The present review focuses on the flow and interaction of somatosensory-motor signals in the central and peripheral nervous system. Specifically, where incoming sensory signals from the periphery are processed and interpreted to initiate behaviors, and how ongoing behaviors produce sensory consequences encoded and used to fine-tune subsequent actions. We describe the structure-function relations of this loop, how these relations can be modeled and aspects of somatosensory-motor rehabilitation. The work reviewed here shows that it is imperative to understand the fundamental mechanisms of the somatosensory-motor system to restore accurate motor abilities and appropriate somatosensory feedback. Knowledge of the salient neural mechanisms of sensory-motor integration has begun to generate innovative approaches to improve rehabilitation training following neurological impairments such as stroke. The present work supports the integration of basic science principles of sensory-motor integration into rehabilitation procedures to create new solutions for sensory-motor disorders. © 2016 R.

AB In the present day technology creation, automation is a promising technology towards the achievement of constructive, innovative and sustainable designs and products in industry 4. The control system of machines that involves the application of mechatronic objects or intelligent units which are envisioned as building blocks for design of the systems are rather configured than being designed. In order to meet dynamic customer needs, within minimal time frames, thereby achieving short-time-to-market. The crucial element in this scenario is that the customer drives the pace and direction of the manufacturing entity. The reality of the matter is that the manufacturer needs to produce customer-centric designed products, and this may be achieved through the use of machinery and a system configured to satisfy the need. Realizing this scenario, in this article, an automated agent-based control system methodology (ACSME) has been proposed for Reconfigurable Bending Press Machine (RBPM) application due to ongoing research. The proposed methodology will help manufacturer of RBPM to address the need for more flexible control systems and to demonstrate their industrial flexibility in several reconfigurable machines applications. © 2016 The Authors.

AB The competencies to manage an engineering project, work in and lead a team are demanded from a graduate of a higher engineering education. A design education model, consisting of of two linked courses, is presented that allows students to learn key engineering and social competencies by experiencing real situations. During the course "Innovation Project" (IP) approx. 450 freshman solve a development task in a team (creating a mechatronic system). The course "Leading Engineering Projects and Coaching Design Teams" educates IP student coaches in team dynamics and how to coach an innovation team. The aim of this paper is to present the recent development of the educational model. In this paper we focus on the IP course. The team climate curves are analysed and the qualitative data describing the turning points in the team climate curves is used to derive critical competencies for the IP teams. Four different competency clusters were found. The results show that not only technical skills are learned in this course but even more so multidisciplinary skills. The influence of the coaches for competency development is ongoing research and will be evaluated in further research. The results underline the need for educational approaches that focus on technical skills as well as multidisciplinary skills. The education model prepares the students well for their future design challenges. © 2016 The Authors.

AB Experimental modal analysis is commonly associated with the use of simulation models for validation, correlation and model updating. However, this interaction between simulation and test is constantly evolving, not in the least because it can be applied to model-based design engineering in the broad sense. Over time, new simulation methods have emerged and consequently, new approaches combining experimental and numerical methodologies are needed and possible. Model Based System Testing (MBST) is an innovative paradigm that allows to structure this process and, in particular, to investigate how the well-established modal testing and analysis procedures and ways of working can be adopted to the multiphysical nature of mechatronic systems. As a result, many possibilities arise

AB The fish embryo toxicity (FET) biotest has gained popularity as one of the alternative approaches to acute fish toxicity tests in chemical hazard and risk assessment. Despite the importance and common acceptance of FET, it is still performed in multiwell plates and requires laborious and time-consuming manual manipulation of specimens and solutions. This work describes the design and validation of a microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technology for automation of the zebrafish embryo toxicity test common in aquatic ecotoxicology. The innovative device supports rapid loading and immobilization of large numbers of zebrafish embryos suspended in a continuous microfluidic perfusion as a means of toxicant delivery. Furthermore, we also present development of a customized mechatronic automation interface that includes a high-resolution USB microscope, LED cold light illumination, and miniaturized 3D printed pumping manifolds that were integrated to enable time-resolved in situ analysis of developing fish embryos. To investigate the applicability of the microfluidic FET (μFET) in toxicity testing, copper sulfate, phenol, ethanol, caffeine, nicotine, and dimethyl sulfoxide were tested as model chemical stressors. Results obtained on a chip-based system were compared with static protocols performed in microtiter plates. This work provides evidence that FET analysis performed under microperfusion opens a brand new alternative for inexpensive automation in aquatic ecotoxicology. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB Flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) used for electrical energy storage are, from the economic point of view, an interesting alternative to batteries and supercaps where a high number of charge-/discharge cycles per day occurs. It is a fact that currently available state of the art FESS show for this type of application too high losses. The key research focus at the Institute of Mechanics and Mechatronics deals with the development of innovative FESS with high energy efficiency and reliability. During three funded research projects the fundamental basics for a technological step regarding storage time, safety and cost reduction have been achieved. In this paper, an extensive overall concept for highest reliability is presented to ensure the function of the bearing for any possible error that can occur in the mechatronic system. Furthermore, a detailed description of the developed optimization concept is provided, that uses a three step procedure containing an automatic election of over 100 geometry- and control parameter depending on the chosen application. The paper closes with a discussion of the developed FESS test rig and the result of a first spin down experiment to validate the calculated losses. © 2015, Springer Verlag Wien.

AB Cyber Physical Systems are an evolution of embedded systems featuring a tight combination of collaborating computational elements that control physical entities. CPSs promise a great potential of innovation in many areas including manufacturing and production. This is because we obtain a very powerful, flexible, modular infrastructure allowing easy (re) configurability and fast ramp-up of manufacturing applications by building a manufacturing system with modular mechatronic components (for machining, transportation and storage) and embedded intelligence, by integrating them into a system, through a network connection. However, when building such kind of architectures, the way to supply the needed domain knowledge to real manufacturing applications arises as a problem to solve. In fact, a CPS based architecture for manufacturing is made of smart but independent manufacturing components without any knowledge of the role they have to play together in the real world of manufacturing applications. Ontologies can supply such kind of knowledge, playing a very important role in CPS for manufacturing. The paper deals with this intriguing theme, also presenting an implementation of this approach in a research project for the open automation of manufacturing systems, in which the power of CPS is complemented by the support of an ontology of the manufacturing domain.

AB It has a need to meet the demands of individual customers and solve the problems in current production caused by changing of the markets and the global influence and general competition situation. Utilization of the progress achieved in the information and communication technologies are expected in the future for many manufacturing companies. This leads to the increasing and consistent integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into the production systems in smaller and smaller subsystems and components. Cyber-Physical System will be more and more involved in production systems. Mechatronic systems become cyber-physical systems through additional communication skills and autonomy in behavior on external influences and internally stored settings. In the Cyber-Physical Production System, the horizontal integration through value networks and the vertical integration through networked manufacturing systems can be built to realize smart factory and smart production. In a laboratory environment at the Experimental and Digital Factory at the Chemnitz University of Technology, an innovative logistical system is built up to apply the horizontal and vertical integration into practice for research investigations. A research question to be answered is how the communication between components in this system related to the horizontal and vertical integration can be implemented. The other issue is how to test the integration and the functionalities. © 2015 IEEE.

AB Traditionally, the development of complex mechatronic products, such as products in aerospace or automotive domain, have employed a "document-based" Systems Engineering (SE) approach to perform the systems engineering activities. This approach is characterized by the generation of textual specifications and design documents that are used and exchanged between all project users. Today, innovative interdisciplinary product development requires a rethinking of current methods and IT solutions, employing an efficient Systems Engineering strategy. The goal is to move from a "documentbased" approach to a "model-based" approach that addresses all engineering disciplines. The "Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)" methodology is an approach that involves modeling for supporting system requirements definition and management, design, analysis, verification and validation activities. This approach provides a set of data and models that allows design teams to analyze the performances of the different product configurations in an early stage and to ensure product data traceability along the entire product lifecycle maintaining a structured relation between costumer requirements and all the product solution analyzed. At present a shared operative approached aimed at integrating MBSE in a Product Life Cycle Management scenario doesn't exist. For that reason, the paper outlines the key activities to deploy successfully a MBSE methodology, based on the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) within a PLM platform by the use of the Product Functional View. © 2015 IEEE.

AB This paper reviews new developments in high-tech greenhouse horticulture. It will focus on sensors, energy solutions, covering materials, production technology and robotics. Driving forces for new technologies are identified and Dutch greenhouse crop production is used as an example. Sensors are introduced in horticulture using the latest techniques from medical and industrial research. A 3D volumetric intersection technique is used to sort tomato seedlings at a speed of 40.000 pieces per hour and measures the full 3D geometric features, which is clearly an impossible challenge when done manually. Other 3D techniques like stereo vision, time of flight and laser triangulation are introduced in greenhouse horticulture to control robots, measure the geometric quality features as flower diameter and bulb orientation or to separate target features from its agricultural surroundings (e.g., Anthurium, chicory, lily bulbs). But also the interest to measure internal quality features as ripeness, food compounds, internal defects and the ability of photosynthesis capacity can be measured by spectral cameras, fluorescence techniques and X-ray. First applications in research and production are being introduced (e.g., rose, Alstroemeria, tulip, tomato or cucumber). To apply integrated management on pests and diseases in the greenhouse, sensors are needed to determine pests and diseases and its magnitude automatically at an early stage (e.g., long horn beetle, botrytis, sticky plates). More future sensor applications are expected in this field. New developments in energy solutions in greenhouses will lead to more profitable options in crop production. Energy saving in horticulture has been the subject of research for more than 20 years in a special program "greenhouse as energy source" financed by the Dutch ministry of agriculture and growers. The result is that Horticultural industry in The Netherlands consumes now 50% less energy compared to 1990 due to all energy saving measures. Various technologies developed are now common practice in greenhouses like the application of thermal screens and temperature integration. More recent developments in humidity control have been adopted further decreasing energy consumption and thereby even increasing production quality and quantity. Alternative energy sources like geothermal heat are being used by some growers allowing fossil-fuel free vegetable production. More futuristic concepts where electricity and heat are produced in combination with greenhouse production are still in the experimental phase. When all new developments lead to products with excellent quality in the right amount, price and ready just in time, products need to be harvested with a predictable capacity and reliability. Progress is made on robotic harvesting of fruits, flowers and vegetables. First robots that are tested in practice on a 24/7 base (cutrose, strawberry, kiwi) have shown to be very close to market introduction. Progress is made and big efforts by several consortia are put in actual developments to harvest tomato leaves, cucumbers and sweet peppers. Self-learning algorithms, open source robotic software and generic mechatronic solutions are available and adaptive to new tasks and products and will enable fast future robot solutions after first successful introductions.

AB This paper proposes lab work for learning fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in mechatronic systems. These skills are important for engineering education because FDD is a key capability of competitive processes and products. The intended outcome of the lab work is that students become aware of the importance of faulty conditions and learn to design FDD strategies for a real system. To this end, the paper proposes a lab project where students are requested to develop a discrete event dynamic system (DEDS) diagnosis to cope with two faulty conditions in an autonomous mobile robot task. A sample solution is discussed for LEGO Mindstorms NXT robots with LabVIEW. This innovative practice is relevant to higher education engineering courses related to mechatronics, robotics, or DEDS. Results are also given of the application of this strategy as part of a postgraduate course on fault-tolerant mechatronic systems. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB This paper presents a novel mechatronics master-slave setup for hand telerehabilitation. The system consists of a sensorized glove acting as a remote master and a powered hand exoskeleton acting as a slave. The proposed architecture presents three main innovative solutions. First, it provides the therapist with an intuitive interface (a sensorized wearable glove) for conducting the rehabilitation exercises. Second, the patient can benefit from a robot-aided physical rehabilitation in which the slave hand robotic exoskeleton can provide an effective treatment outside the clinical environment without the physical presence of the therapist. Third, the mechatronics setup is integrated with a sensorized object, which allows for the execution of manipulation exercises and the recording of patient's improvements. In this paper, we also present the results of the experimental characterization carried out to verify the system usability of the proposed architecture with healthy volunteers. © 2015 IEEE.

AB In order to increase and maintain their businesses, mechatronics manufacturers develop innovative products and reduce product development costs. Economic constraints motivate them to reduce the duration of the testing phase and the number of prototypes and to develop simulations. Introducing innovations enables them to meet customers' expectations and stand out from their competitors. However the risk that their products might not function correctly in operational conditions must be evaluated with precision as defects during the warranty period have a negative impact on the bottom line. To reduce these industrial and financial risks and respect the levels of performance and reliability required, reliability actions need to be part of design. This chapter describes a reliability-based design optimization approach which is adapted to mechatronics systems. The first step involves establishing predictive reliability of the electronics system in operational conditions based on the FIDES reliability manual. This recent manual based on probability laws is regularly updated according to field returns. The objectives of the following steps are to identify the potentially faulty elements in the life profile conditions and to establish stress distributions leading to failures. In order to understand failure mechanisms, the effects of mechanical, thermal and electromagnetic loads on several prototypes are characterized experimentally. After this, tests are used to provoke failures. Consecutive failure analysis helps to develop multiphysics failure models. These models are optimized and validated by comparing model responses to thermal or vibratory solicitations and those obtained experimentally. Developing meta models capable of treating the variability of life profile loads and of fabrication enables reliability predictions. Design is then optimized by adjusting the architecture elements which are critical for reliability. © ISTE Press Ltd 2015.

AB The increasing electrification of powertrains within automotive vehicles is driven by the demand of alternative drivetrains and modern vehicle concepts. Based on this development trend, mechatronic systems within automotive engineering are gaining more importance. Simultaneously, quality and safety requirements become very challenging for car manufacturers as well as car suppliers regarding the decrease of default risk and increase of component reliability. In this context, the safety-relevant aspects in the development of mechatronic systems have to be considered. The high number of technical properties and complex connections of mechatronics systems in the development of modern vehicles requires innovative analysis and valuation methods. Classical analysing methods, such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), represent the state of the art. The aforementioned methods have been developed considering classical approaches and they suited for mechanical products in the past. However, the requirements of safety standards can only be fulfilled in combination with different analysis methods, which lead to redundancy and low efficiency. Therefore, conventional analysing methods do not provide satisfying solutions for complex mechatronic systems. A modern development process for mechatronic components requires a new, innovative analysis method to optimize the behaviour and fail functions within the system, to recognize hazardous situations, to evaluate their consequences, as well as to define measures to optimize the whole development process. © 2015, Springer Verlag Wien.

AB  In recent decades the application of bioreactors has revolutionized the concept of culturing tissues and organs that require mechanical loading. In intervertebral disc (IVD) research, collaborative efforts of biomedical engineering, biology and mechatronics have led to the innovation of new loading devices that can maintain viable IVD organ explants from large animals and human cadavers in precisely defined nutritional and mechanical environments over extended culture periods. Particularly in spine and IVD research, these organ culture models offer appealing alternatives, as large bipedal animal models with naturally occurring IVD degeneration and a genetic background similar to the human condition do not exist. Latest research has demonstrated important concepts including the potential of homing of mesenchymal stem cells to nutritionally or mechanically stressed IVDs, and the regenerative potential of “smart” biomaterials for nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosus repair. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about cell therapy, injection of cytokines and short peptides to rescue the degenerating IVD. We further stress that most bioreactor systems simplify the real in vivo conditions providing a useful proof of concept. Limitations are that certain aspects of the immune host response and pain assessments cannot be addressed with ex vivo systems. Coccygeal animal disc models are commonly used because of their availability and similarity to human IVDs. Although in vitro loading environments are not identical to the human in vivo situation, 3D ex vivo organ culture models of large animal coccygeal and human lumbar IVDs should be seen as valid alternatives for screening and feasibility testing to augment existing small animal, large animal, and human clinical trial experiments. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB Railway vehicles adopt mechatronic devices to maximize the traction/braking effort. These systems often use complex algorithms that require long experimental validation tests on track. The possibility to perform the same tests on a roller-rig gives the opportunity to simplify the validation activity, under safe conditions, and to reduce the costs. The main challenge is to be able to reproduce the same adhesion conditions on a roller-rig with respect to the track, especially in degraded conditions. First, the paper shows experiments performed to reproduce degraded adhesion on a conventional roller-rig for a single wheelset. Then, an innovative roller-rig is proposed in order to reproduce the effect of the passage of several wheelsets on the track. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB This paper addresses education on scientific publication skills for post-graduate engineering students. In particular, a project-based learning strategy is proposed to lead students through the preparation a research paper. Expected learning outcomes are related to finding and evaluating the quality of references, editing and formatting text in LATEX, writing scientific papers with appropriate style and structure, peer reviewing, and making technical presentations. This approach has been developed to increase the internationalization and visibility of young researchers by improving the quality standards of their published works. The purpose of this innovative practice is that students confront the major challenges of the publication process in the classroom, which is in contrast with the traditional self-taught approach experienced by the authors and many senior researchers. The proposed strategy is being applied as a required course in the Master in Mechatronics Engineering of the University of Malaga. This paper offers preliminary results from this experience. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Ongoing advances in mechatronic components and power electronics help to improve control systems within automotive applications. New developed or designed components enable more efficient system architectures and control. The management of several parameters of future drive architectures, such as high torque and power output, high system efficiency, low mass, low energy consumption, very low exhaust gas emissions, and low costs is essential for future propulsion concepts. Based on these development trends, mechatronic systems within automotive engineering are gaining more and more importance. At the same time, quality and safety requirements become challenging for automotive manufacturers as well as their suppliers regarding the decrease of default risk and increase of component reliability in a high degree. Therefore, safety-relevant aspects in the development of modern mechatronic systems have to be considered thoroughly. The high number of technical properties and complex connections of mechatronics systems in the development of modern vehicles are very challenging for state-of-the-art analysis methods. For this reason, new and innovational safety concepts are required, to optimize existing safety concepts using conventional components and methods in combination. This paper includes a detailed comparison of different analyzing methods, to identify systematically and random failures, as well as safety standards, such as IEC 61508 (Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems) and ISO 26262 (Road vehicles-Functional safety), which requires a classification in ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level). To fulfil nowadays safety standards for complex mechatronic systems, several different analysis methods have to be applied. Only the connection of any safe fault recognition with a safe fault reaction enables a system to avoid harmful consequences. Regarding product development, there is an ongoing change from routine tests (durability tests) to testing selected parts of a safety function (fault injection tests). How action is taken is changing, with a trend towards a further development of IT tools, supporting functional safe systems holistically, including hazard and risk assessment, integrated system analysis of systematic and random failures, and hardware metrics. The publication closes with an overview of a functional safety concept and presents an outlook to future trends of safety systems analysis.

AB This paper discusses the effects of inerter-based passive networks in the design of novel mechatronic solutions for improving the vertical performance of a bogied railway vehicle. Combinations of inerter-based structures and active suspensions comprise distinct novel mechatronic solutions for the vertical secondary suspension of the vehicle. The parameters of the active and passive parts of the overall configuration are optimised so that a synergy arises to enhance the vehicle vertical performance and simplify common mechatronic suspension design conflicts. The study is performed by combining inerter-based suspensions with well-established active control (output-based and model-based) strategies for ride quality enhancement. Also, a novel nonlinear control strategy, here called Adaptive Stiffness, is incorporated for suspension deflection regulation to complement the well-known local implementation of skyhook damping. This would complete a significant set of control strategies to produce general conclusions. The vehicle performance is assessed through the vertical accelerations of the vehicle body as an initial investigation. Attained results show the potential of the inerter concept for innovating mechatronic technologies to achieve substantial improvements in railway vehicle vertical ride quality with reduced actuator force. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB The safety of products is one essential feature on the way to approval. Methods of safety analysis are applied to ensure this. Facing growing demand for individual products and stricter regulations, these analyses require increasing efforts. In mechanical and mechatronic engineering, these analyses in practice are dominated by traditional methods. Current research aims to improve and enhance this process of considering safety during all stages in design. However, these works mainly focus on software or embedded systems. Thus, this paper aims to understand the current practices and challenges in mechanical or mechatronic engineering. It examines existing approaches from literature and records the industrial practices within an interview study. Challenges in safety analysis are discussed with special focus on increasing variance and user innovation concepts. By that our paper contributes to a better understanding of current and upcoming challenges in the domain of mechanical and mechatronic engineering and identifies the needs and directions for further research.

AB Ongoing technological progress in measurement systems triggered the development of an innovative, hands-on teaching program to help students toward a fuller understanding of recent changes in the field. This paper presents a lab project that links theoretical principles with the practical issues of signal conditioning systems. This is accomplished in the context of a Master's Degree in Mechatronic Engineering, though the experience gained could be applied to other curricula. Students designed and tested a signal conditioning circuit in order to acquire and monitor the electrical activity generated by the heart. This lab project contains most of the circuits studied in lectures and presents a general methodology for the design of signal conditioning systems. Five years of lab project work was compiled, and with the help of students' feedback, we were able to evaluate both the improvement in their knowledge and in their motivation.

AB During the last years mechatronic systems developed into one of the biggest drivers of innovation in the automotive industry. The start of production of systems like dual clutch transmission, lane departure warning systems and active suspensions proves this statement. These systems have an influence on the longitudinal, steering and vertical dynamics of the vehicle. That is why the interaction on vehicle level is crucial for an optimal result in the fields of efficiency, comfort, safety and dynamics. To optimize the interaction of mechatronic systems, in this paper a new test rig concept for a complete vehicle is presented. The so-called Car-in-the-Loop-concept is capable of realistically reproducing the loads, which act on the powertrain, the steering and the suspension during a test drive. The resulting advantages are the possibility to exactly reproduce test procedures, the independence from weather conditions and a minimization of the risk of human injuries during testing of safety functions. A prototype of this concept, which includes parts of the powertrain, the steering and the chassis corresponding to the left front side of a BMW Mini Countryman, was built at the lab of the Institute for Mechatronic Systems in Mechanical Engineering of the TU Darmstadt. A test rig shaft connects the wheelhub of the BMW Mini Countryman to actuators, which generate realistic loads corresponding to the current driving situation. To provide the needed adaptiveness for the steering and suspension movement constant velocity joints and ball-spline supported length compensations are included in the test rig shaft. A highly dynamic test drive is being reproduced on the prototype to prove the functionality of the Car-in-the-Loop-concept. Copyright © 2015 SAE International.

AB User innovation toolkits offer many benefits, for example the efficient access to customer needs, the realisation of individual products and reduced development risks. While these toolkits are spread in many industries, they are not very common for mechanical or mechatronic products. To improve the applicability of these toolkits, our paper develops a general concept of an "ideal" user innovation toolkit. It examines existing applications in a benchmark analysis, develops seven dimensions to categorize user innovation toolkits and identifies best practices. Based on these findings the general concept is derived. It provides support in the early phase of user innovation toolkit design and helps companies to find suitable trade-offs and to develop a tailored solution for their purposes. By that our paper contributes to a better applicability of the user innovation approach.

AB The authors of the article carried out the analysis of the teaching need for the subject of engineering change at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. The conducted investigation was based on evaluating the situation of the engineering change process and on innovative knowledge in the field. The examination of literature sources and the results of expert evaluation pointed out a number of activities to support the engineering change process. The activities must be provided with relevant innovative knowledge. Recent engineering changes are related to product and process innovations when the new functions and purposes of product development can be, in many cases, achieved through designing mechatronic systems and introducing new materials to improve the product. Engineering change management is important for designing and producing products. For this reason, the modules of study programmes in this particular field give more knowledge and abilities for the students. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB This paper provides an innovative design for a gliding robotic dolphin. In order to realize high maneuverability and long endurance, the robotic dolphin combines the advantages of both robotic dolphins and underwater gliders. It can not only realize fast and flexible dolphin-like swimming depending on the powerful propulsive posterior body and fluke, but also implement gently and durable gliding motion due to the buoyancy-driven system. More importantly, the controllable pectoral fins and horizontal fluke can effectively complete the attitude adjustment, so traditional internal movable masses could be removed for saving a considerable space. Besides, the hydrodynamic analysis in the steady gliding motion is executed and hydrodynamic coefficients including lift, drag, and pitching moment are also obtained through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. Finally, extensive experiments including dolphin-like swimming, spiraling motion and gently gliding motion illustrate the great locomotion ability of the developed gliding robotic dolphin. © 2015 IEEE.

AB Mastering the art of ‘mechatronics’ currently looks like one of the most attractive tasks of modern engineering technology and science. Many applications resort to the interdisciplinary approach of mechatronics to enhance the performance, quality and safety of either product or process. Some are very traditional (like hard disk drives, biomedical, automotive and aerospace systems) while others are fairly new (like micro and nano electromechanical systems, unmanned air vehicles, intelligent machining, manufacturing systems or bioinspired devices). This book describe some practical examples, which demonstrate how different competences, disciplines and technologies meet in an innovative mechatronic system. They deal with several domains like the hard disk drive technology, biomedical prostheses, fluidic automation, UAV Vision System, vibration monitoring and suppression in steelmaking plants, materials machining and smart composites. These examples will show the reader, who is still looking for the real meaning of mechatronics, how some innovative technologies allow implementing a sort of artificial intelligence in several systems currently produced. Examples describe neural network positioning control, chaos prevention, myoelectric stimulation of prosthesis, human detection by vision system, multi-physics modeling and control of dynamics. Some topics are related to small scale, as in the case of a finger of a biotronic hand. Nevertheless, the same approach is applied even to huge machines, like the electric arc furnace. It is worth noticing that the authors resorted even to the additive manufacturing, as in prototyping bio-prostheses, or to fiber optics embedded into composite structures. Those technologies allow reducing cost, weight or volume of product. In some cases, the mechatronic approach improves the quality and the accuracy of some material processing, like in rolling or in turning against the risk of self-excited chatter vibration. The examples described in this book cover a wide range of mechatronic applications. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sensata Technologies Holding N.V., a global industrial technology company, is a leader in the development, manufacture and sale of sensors and controls. It produces a wide range of customized, innovative sensors and controls for mibion critical applications such as thermal circuit breakers in aircraft, prebure sensors in automotive systems, and bimetal current and temperature control devices in electric motors. Busineb centers and manufacturing sites in twelve countries are involved in the engineering proceb for over 50 OEMs all over the world. Providing that the engineered data is delivered to the recipient in the right format, quality and time is crucial in the collaboration between Sensata and its customer. As the numbers of partners and CAD systems (which differ by releases) expand the complexity exponentially, a direct transfer and translation service resembles a big challenge for Sensata's IT. Not to mention that know-how protection is becoming increasingly important and is usually a part of the exchange proceb. Sensata has tackled the challenge by establishing a focal point of data exchange and translation (including a knowledge protection proceb), which can be controlled in an easy way to ensure that the compliance of Sensata is kept. The OpenDESC.com service, utilized by Sensata as the focal point of data exchange and translation, is capable of sending data to all Sensata partners, ensuring the desired translation and knowledge protection settings and standards are set to the newest releases. By this Sensata is independent from the standards and tools their partners use. Therefore a partner's transition to JT or other formats does not affect the engineering proceb at Sensata, which leads to large efficiency and quality gains and cost savings. This paper describes the requirements in the engineering collaboration of mechatronic product development and implemented solution. © 2015 The authors and IOS Preb.

AB FlexRay networks is known as one of the newest x-by wire communication systems [1] thanks to its several features such as flexibility, fault-tolerance, determinism and high-speed. It is known for their speed and performance insuring communication over a shared medium since it offers reliable and real-time capable high-speed data transmission between electrical and mechatronic components. In the same context, the real-time middleware Data Distribution Service (DDS) is an appropriate alternative for the standard vehicular middleware. In this paper, we focus our interest on the development of FlexRay Driver and the Simulink Blockset implementation of its Driver in order to validate its performances and design and to provide current and future innovative functions into distributed systems within automotive applications. The proposed blockset is dedicated for the SAE(Society of Automotive Engineers) application. The SAE benchmark model is normally connected by the CAN bus we extended it to the FlexRay Bus. We have applied the real-time middleware Data Distribution Service (DDS) in order to guarantee the QoS of SAE benchmark using the FlexRay protocol. © 2015 IEEE.

Despite importance of such behavioral biotests, their implementation is profoundly limited by the lack of appropriate biocompatible automation, integrated optoelectronic sensors, and the associated electronics and analysis algorithms. This work outlines development of a proof-of-concept miniaturized Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) platform for rapid water toxicity tests based on changes in swimming patterns exhibited by Artemia franciscana (Artoxkit M™) nauplii. In contrast to conventionally performed end-point analysis based on counting numbers of dead/immobile specimens we performed a time-resolved video data analysis to dynamically assess impact of a reference toxicant on swimming pattern of A. franciscana.

AB Behavioral ecotoxicity tests are gaining an increasing recognition in environmental toxicology. Behavior of sensitive bioindicator species can change rapidly in response to an acute exposure to contaminants and thus has a much higher sensitivity as compared to conventional LC50 mortality tests. Furthermore, behavioral endpoints seems to be very good candidates to develop early-warning biomonitoring systems needed for rapid chemical risk assessment. Behavioral tests are non-invasive, fast, do not harm indicator organisms (behavioural changes are very rapid) and are thus fully compatible with 3R (Replacement-Reduction-Refinement) principle encouraging alternatives to conventional animal testing. These characteristics are essential when designing improved ecotoxicity tests for chemical risk assessment. In this work, we present a pilot development of miniaturized Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) devices for studying toxin avoidance behaviors of small aquatic crustaceans. As an investigative tool, LOCs represent a new direction that may miniaturize and revolutionize behavioral ecotoxicology. Specifically our innovative microfluidic prototype

AB Mechanical engineering (ME) departments in research universities face the challenge of educating mechanical engineers who will graduate with a balanced knowledge in engineering science and mechanical design. The source of this challenge is the inherent difference between teaching analytical thinking, which is required for most engineering-science courses, and design thinking, which is required for project-based design courses. The purpose of this paper is first to propose a new approach that can potentially bridge the educational gap between analytical and design thinking, which we refer to as integrated thinking. Second, we show how it can be applied to various ME undergraduate courses, which we refer to as integrated courses. Our approach reforms science engineering courses by (a) stressing the physical interpretation of mathematical derivations; (b) requiring students to analyze, design, and sketch simple mechanical devices based on the learned theoretical material; and (c) modifying project-based design courses to emphasize the importance of analysis as part of the creative design process. A pilot course focusing on dynamics and vibration, which we called Integrated Design and Analysis, was offered in the ME department at the Technion, where it was well-attended by senior ME students. The positive feedback of the students who took the course suggests that integrated thinking might be successfully applied in many areas of ME education, such as fluid mechanics and heat transfer, control, and mechatronics, and that our approach may contribute to changing the current divided pattern in ME education. © 2015 The Authors.

AB Purpose. Though already proclaimed about 7 years ago, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is still in its early stages. A multidisciplinary working team tried to analyze the technical obstacles and identify potential solutions. Methods. After a comprehensive review of the literature, a group of 3 surgeons, 1 gastroenterologist, 10 engineers, and 1 representative of biomedical industry defined the most important deficiencies within the system and then compiled as well as evaluated innovative technologies that could be used to help overcome these problems. These technologies were classified with regard to the time needed for their implementation and associated hindrances, where priority is based on the level of impact and significance that it would make. Results. Both visualization and actuation require significant improvement. Advanced illumination, mist elimination, image stabilization, view extension, 3-dimensional stereoscopy, and augmented reality are feasible options and could optimize visual information. Advanced mechatronic platforms with miniaturized, powerful actuators, and intuitive human-machine interfaces could optimize dexterity, as long as enabling technologies are used. The latter include depth maps in real time, precise navigation, fast pattern recognition, partial autonomy, and cognition systems. Conclusion. The majority of functional deficiencies that still exist in NOTES platforms could be overcome by a broad range of already existing or emerging enabling technologies. To combine them in an optimal manner, a permanent dialogue between researchers and clinicians is mandatory. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB Respiratory problems are among the main causes of mortality for preterm newborns with pulmonary diseases; mechanical ventilation provides standard care, but long-term complications are still largely reported. In this framework, continuous medical education is mandatory to correctly manage assistance devices. However, commercially available neonatal respiratory simulators are rarely suitable for representing anatomical and physiological conditions; a step toward high-fidelity simulation, therefore, is essential for nurses and neonatologists to acquire the practice needed without any risk. An innovative multi-compartmental infant respirator simulator based on a five-lobe model was developed to reproduce different physio-pathological conditions in infants and to simulate many different kinds of clinical scenarios. The work consisted of three phases

AB Modern tendencies of higher education require development of master programs providing achievement of learning outcomes corresponding to quickly variable job market needs. ITMO University represented by Applied and Computer Optics Department and Optical Design and Testing Laboratory jointly with Warsaw University of Technology represented by the Institute of Micromechanics and Photonics at The Faculty of Mechatronics have developed a novel international master double-degree program "Optical Design" accumulating the expertise of both universities including experienced teaching staff, educational technologies, and experimental resources. The program presents studies targeting research and professional activities in high-tech fields connected with optical and optoelectronics devices, optical engineering, numerical methods and computer technologies. This master program deals with the design of optical systems of various types, assemblies and layouts using computer modeling means; investigation of light distribution phenomena; image modeling and formation; development of optical methods for image analysis and optical metrology including optical testing, materials characterization, NDT and industrial control and monitoring. The goal of this program is training a graduate capable to solve a wide range of research and engineering tasks in optical design and metrology leading to modern manufacturing and innovation. Variability of the program structure provides its flexibility and adoption according to current job market demands and personal learning paths for each student. In addition considerable proportion of internship and research expands practical skills. Some special features of the "Optical Design" program which implements the best practices of both Universities, the challenges and lessons learnt during its realization are presented in the paper. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

AB One major goal of the Rethinking Prototyping project is to bring scientists from different domains like engineering and arts to explore collaboratively new approaches of development and testing of Product Service Systems (PSS). PSS combine products, services, and infrastructure to fulfil individual customer needs. Therefore, the development of PSS is an extension of traditional engineering design process, which mainly refers to purely tangible products or intangible services into an integrated development process of products and services. The basis is a new technology called Smart Hybrid Prototyping (SHP), a joint development by Fraunhofer IPK and the TU Berlin. SHP is an innovative technology for a multimodal interdisciplinary evaluation of virtual prototypes in early development stages. It is based upon methods of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital virtuality. The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid bicycle simulator were derived. Why a bicycle simulator? Well, we are firmly convinced that the future of urban mobility is determined from trends such as ecological rethinking and the desire for sports and healthy life. Furthermore, it is one of the most competitive and agile markets using most innovative materials and manufacturing technologies. © 2015 The Authors.

AB Nowadays, innovations in many products ranging from customer electronics to high-end industry electric/electronic components are driven by software. Thus, new or extended features to software and mechatronic products can be realized and deployed to the market much faster. While the use of software enables an enormous flexibility, mastering the ever-growing complexity of the resulting products to meet the quality goals required for the market is getting more and more challenging. Continuous development combined with continuous testing is a successful method that actively incorporates the customer to get feedback for the feature to be deployed early, and thus, product owners, developers, and testers can collaborate more effectively to meet the market's needs. From literature, setting up such an agile development process is clear; the individual situation in terms of organization, processes, and development and test tooling however is depending on the company-many of the aforementioned aspects have grown over the years and cannot be easily changed. In this article, we present the CIViT model, which allows companies to get an explicit understanding and overview of their current testing and integration activities. With CIViT's intuitive representation of the current status, companies are able to identify bottlenecks and derive actions points to evolve their processes, methods, and development and test tooling towards a more agile and continuous deployment-oriented organization. Thus, they will be able to develop, integrate, evaluate, and deploy new features faster to the end user, hence strengthening their own market position. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB Mass rapid transit (MRT) technology had gone through a very comprehensive and intensive evolution in recent decades. Those developments and innovations occurred in both technological and engineering aspects. In this project, a laboratory-scaled mass rapid transit system based on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is built. The motivation of this project is to design and develop a laboratory scaled mass rapid transit system that can demonstrate the operation of a real MRT system to the public. Omron CJ2M series PLC, Shihlin Electric Human-machine-interface EU200 series, Lego 7938 City Train Set and Arduino microcontroller board are used to develop the system. Several NPN sensors are implemented in the system to perform the automated operation of a real MRT system. Other devices such as servo motor, light-emitting diode and DC motor are used to support the primary function of the rail system. In addition, simulation software in controlling the operation of an MRT system is also developed. The outcome has significantly contributed towards in depth knowledge and practical understanding of mechatronic system development and implementation. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Recently, a new product design and development style, in which external engineers at remote place can join the project for a collaborative work, is noticed as one type of the open innovation. In this paper, a web-based mechatronic simulation environment is improved by the realization of a new prototype implementation scheme. Such one environment can be used for design of products with both mechanical and electrical structure and their behaviors can be simulated together. The scheme is one of coupled simulations over multi-disciplinal fields. As an example, a simple environment for a positioning machine design as a mechatronic product is implemented. Through a case study to model and simulate a positioning table motion, the effect of the proposed environment is verified. © 2014 IEEE.

AB In this paper, the optimal mechatronic design of a regenerative chatter controller in a lathe machine is presented. As an innovative consideration, a structured artificial immune system (AIS) is utilized for optimization of the topology and the parameter values of the system. To remove the chatter in a specific spindle speed, a mechatronic system including smart piezoelectric actuator, piezoelectric sensor and controller is designed. A rather comprehensive structure is considered for the transfer function of the controller with the aim to cover common types of industrial controllers. The overall objective of the present work is to design an active vibration suppression system in order to increase the allowable depth of cut at a specific spindle speed, with minimum energy consumption. © 2014 IEEE.

AB Reviewing the evolutionary trend of the models used in design and development of mechatronic products reveals the necessity for integration of the design characteristics and requirements in various engineering fields. Such products should agilely embrace rapid, persistent and complex requirements in competitive environments. This research aims to develop an integrated model for designing and developing mechatronic products within the context of agile production system. The study tries to eliminate unnecessary stages of design and simulation of products and increase the number of tested ideas. This suggests a distinction between product innovation and product improvement cycles and thus makes employing a pre-active approach to responding possible. Since the term "mechatronic products" is often used interchangeably with "robots", one of the most commonly used types of them, i.e. tracer robot is considered as the statistical population for the proposed study. By choosing experimental (laboratory) research method, two categories of tracer robots are created

AB With the emergence of more complex, intelligent mechatronic devices a need for innovative types and techniques of ultra-precision positioning solutions arises. Hybrid actuators have been developed to combine long stroke capability with extremely accurate positioning and tracing performance, previously only available for short distance travel ranges. Successful implementations integrate drive concepts such as piezo modules, spindle drives and voice coil actuators, operated in closed-loop with one position feedback sensor (MISO Systems) [1]. In addition to measuring physical dimensions and distances, a need for high-precision, integrated capabilities with regard to interacting with innovative mechatronic devices occurs. In this paper, a hybrid actuator concept, consisting of a long stroke voice coil drive guided by linear bearings and a flexure-guided force sensor, both based on independent highresolution incremental sensors, is presented.

AB Lightweight design and weight optimization in general are seen as one promising of many approaches to create products and services in a sustainable and resource efficient way. However, most of the methods proposed for lightweight design are applied late in the development process (embodiment and detail design) and mostly locally for specific components and subsystems without regarding the system as a whole. For today's sustainability challenges, the traditional weight improvements are not sufficient anymore. A transfer and an establishment of weight optimization methods to earlier design phases, especially the concept design stage, is needed because of the important influence on product properties in these phases. Moreover, a methodology of weight-optimization for innovative, interdisciplinary products, especially mechatronic products and systems, is missing. In this contribution, a method for the consideration of weight optimization during the creation of function structures, working principles and principle solution structure is presented.

AB This paper explains and demonstrates a method to interconnect the video detection data flow with an innovative coded grid in order to precisely associate absolute coordinates to any scanned (micro) objects over a large area, without the aid of external bulky sensors. The concept of measuring micro-objects absolute coordinates is based on a series of coded information markings (micrometric terminal blocks) regularly and precisely printed on the bottom reference surface. In this manner the image processing could extract the values of the coded markings and precisely provide absolute coordinates for the camera image. The correspondence between the object and its absolute coordinates seems therefore straightforward. Finally it was obtained an innovative mechatronic system made of two essential sub-systems

AB In the last decade researchers pursued the development of tiny flying robots inspired by natural flyers. Within this context our main objective is to devise a flying robot-mimicking insect in terms of kinematics and scale using MEMS technologies. For this purpose, an original design has been developed around resonant thorax and wings by the way of an indirect actuation and a concise transmission. Using such a design prototypes with a wingspan of 3 cm and a mass of 22 mg able to lift 75 % of their weights are achieved. As a part of this global goal, this paper presents an innovative power modeling of a flapping-wing nano air vehicle (FWNAV) actuation-transmission system, aiming at a better comprehension of the power transmission from power source to wings, thus allowing future optimization of the actuation efficiency. Considering the multiphysics nature of the prototype a mechatronic approach has been chosen bringing thus a unique model for the whole system. This model has been realized thanks to Bond Graph formalism, which has the crucial advantage to be adapted to multiphysics systems and energetic analysis. After an experimental validation, it is demonstrated that the main parameter conditioning the overall efficiency of the FWNAV is the interaction between coil's current and magnet remanent magnet flux density. © 2014 IEEE.

AB The paper deals with the methodology used in the development and implementation of an innovative electromechanical energy conversion concept, known as DSgen-set®, on a wind turbine (WT). In order to eliminate the known problem of wind farms being disturbance factors for network quality, an innovative principle is required to avoid the disadvantages of an inverter based system. The newly developed system transforms stochastic wind load acting on the WT into electrical power, over the synchronous generator which is connected directly to the grid. The constant speed of the synchronous generator is controlled via a servo motor. The main challenge of the development was "first-time-right". To achieve that goal a virtual model (VM) approach was used, which considers and evaluates all necessary influences on the system. This VM is a complex mechatronic system which consists of the 3 interactively coupled subsystems (mechanical, electrical and controlling). The developed methodology and the applied tools enable a pre-optimization of the individual sub-systems and the complete DSgen-set® on a virtual test bed before hardware is available. Tests from the DSgen-set® real model (RM) on a test bed were subsequently used for the VM validation. The same approach and method were implemented in further investigations of the complete WT dynamic behavior. With such an advanced VM which considers all known dynamic influences, a deep understanding and solid basis for further development of mechanical design, electrical engineering and automatic control requirements is supported in an efficient way.

AB This work describes the design and performance tests of an innovative fluidic pump system which is applied in a novel anterior and posterior eye surgery system [1]. Traditionally such a pump system is either Venturi tube based, where the pressure response is rather quick and the steady state pressure is stable but the actual flow is hard to control, or use a peristaltic tube pump, where the actual flow can be controlled more accurately but the pressure response is slow and the steady state pressure has significant variations. The newly developed pump is a mechatronic system that interacts with a sterile disposable cartridge. The pump comprises a pressure sensor, a compensation piston (piston 1), an inlet valve (valve 1), a pump piston (piston 2) and an outlet valve (valve 2). All are actuated using direct drive motors in combination with flexible hinges. With this pump it is possible to control either the eye pressure or flow to (irrigation) or from (aspiration) the eye and maintain dynamic safety levels to prevent unwanted behaviour, even if the flow restriction suddenly changes. Measurements show that the response time of this novel pump system is much faster compared with traditional systems, especially in flow mode. Furthermore by properly tuning the movement cycle of the pistons and valves, the pressure stability in flow mode is superior to traditional tube pump systems. This enables eye surgeons to perform delicate operations requiring a very stable aspiration pressures, but without sacrifice of direct aspiration pressure response.

AB Automotive industry is facing nowadays the need to compete in the market in terms of quality, cost and time related to the products which are offered. Vehicle design is developing more and more. To keep up with the technology, the suppliers which are providing the products that fit into the vehicle develop “attractive” parts by using the latest technologies and methods. The customers have very high requirements because, at their turn, they want to offer high quality to the final consumer. Because of this there is a huge competition on the market in terms of range of products. What distinguishes them in final are both price and quality. Due to this, the suppliers are determined to use ideas and designing methods very innovative. In this aspect the design interferes [1] (which occur whenever man creates things), which is considered to be very essential because is the brain of the whole process until the product reaches out the last step in the assembly line. In the design activity, concepts are realised, by starting from a single idea, on which many others are raised in order to fulfil the large range of requirements. These concepts are based on high design knowledge [2] , rules of designing [3] , and previous experience. One of the main requirement which the customers is raising, represents the method through which the interface between the electronic control unit of the car and the product (supplied by the supplier) itself is made [4] . The customers have preferred suppliers of the car connector (female connector), and that is why they require a certain design of the product connector (male connector). They have the expectations that the products which they are buying (sensors, actuators, power converters and any other product which contains an electronic board) to be designed in the connector’s side in such a manner, that they don’t have to change their preferred car connector suppliers. In most of the cases, companies develop products where the connector is directly integrated in the housing. This paper aims to highlight the alternative of designing, by proposing an alternative solution, with which the connection method condition required by the customer is fulfilled. Taking into consideration the mechatronic component, which is founded inside the product, an Aluminium housing must be used, due to its material properties in absorbing the high heat delivered by the complex electronic components. At the end of the article, the advantages and disadvantages of the existing and alternative solution will be discussed. © 2014, Editura Cefin. All right reserved.

AB Reconfigurable Transportation Systems (RTSs) are conceived as multiple independent modules to implement alternative inbound logistic systems' configurations. Together with mechatronic interfaces and distributed control solutions, the full exploitation of RTS plug&produce features rely on flexible production management policies. The current work proposes an innovative approach to dynamically compute part routings in RTSs. It is designed as fully distributed across transportation modules; based on current RTS' topology and status, it ensures the autonomy in selecting routing decisions while embracing global and local evolving optimization strategies. The benefits of the approach have been investigated with reference to an industrial case study. © 2014 CIRP.

AB This paper summarizes recent activities carried out for the development of an innovative anthropomorphic robotic hand called the DEXMART Hand. The main goal of this research is to face the problems that affect current robotic hands by introducing suitable design solutions aimed at achieving simplification and cost reduction while possibly enhancing robustness and performance. While certain aspects of the DEXMART Hand development have been presented in previous papers, this paper is the first to give a comprehensive description of the final hand version and its use to replicate human-like grasping. In this paper, particular emphasis is placed on the kinematics of the fingers and of the thumb, the wrist architecture, the dimensioning of the actuation system, and the final implementation of the position, force and tactile sensors. The paper focuses also on how these solutions have been integrated into the mechanical structure of this innovative robotic hand to enable precise force and displacement control of the whole system.Another important aspect is the lack of suitable control tools that severely limits the development of robotic hand applications. To address this issue, a new method for the observation of human hand behavior during interaction with common day-to-day objects by means of a 3D computer vision system is presented in this work together with a strategy for mapping human hand postures to the robotic hand. A simple control strategy based on postural synergies has been used to reduce the complexity of the grasp planning problem. As a preliminary evaluation of the DEXMART Hand's capabilities, this approach has been adopted in this paper to simplify and speed up the transfer of human actions to the robotic hand, showing its effectiveness in reproducing human-like grasping. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB The need for mechatronic devices that are lightweight, less cumbersome and able to produce small, quick and precise movements or forces is ever increasing in many fields of engineering. Many recent design solutions are based on electrically, magnetically or thermally activated materials, often referred to as smart materials. This tutorial paper overviews the main properties and the resulting applications of two recently discovered smart materials, magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMAs) and electroactive polymers (EAPs), which have complementary characteristics and seem suitable to overcome some of the inherent limitations of other materials widely used in industrial applications, such as piezoelectric ceramics. As many other smart materials, MSMAs and EAPs exhibit nonlinear, hysteretic and time-varying behaviors, and therefore this tutorial discusses the main ways to model and effectively compensate these critical issues with advanced control strategies. © 2014 IEEE.

AB The ability to develop new products to compete in existing or new markets is a core competency of many successful companies. Companies can assess their success from different perspectives, including the overall innovation strategy at company level. This paper evaluates 56 success metrics through the course of product lifecycle (PLC), by considering the influence of the company's business innovation strategy. Data is collected by using survey questionnaires with experienced product development managers of 21 Canadian and Danish companies, mainly practicing in mechatronics and aerospace industry. Outcomes show no statistically significant difference among innovation strategy attributes. 'Financial' and 'market share' are the most important success indicators in early PLC with 'product' and 'process management performance' being more important in the late phase. Moreover, sets of success metrics are proposed during course of the PLC. These aim to guide companies in determining critical success factors and set ideal practices in measuring the success of their products. © 2014 IEEE.

AB The paper presents possibilities of usage of innovative constructions in special vehicles for absorbing of vibrations. The regular vehicles, as passenger cars, have many solutions of suspensions. Depending on purpose of the car it can be generally grouped for soft suspensions with destination for passenger, family cars and hard suspensions for sports cars. According to safety and comfort requirements there are constant research on compromise solution. Thus we have mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically and mechatronic constructions of suspensions. For the passenger cars the project assumptions are much easier to reach. It is assumed that vehicle will be driven on paved the way with carrying load less than construction parameters. For the special vehicles such assumptions can't be done. The vehicles can be used as off road on natural ground and very often with extra load. Thus the universal solutions for suspensions are not good enough. Taking into consideration that special vehicles mostly are constructed basing on regular frame and truck chassis the possible solutions become very narrow. Thus the paper presents an approach with intermediate frame. The analysis presented are just small part of work packages of research programme Demonstrator + Supporting scientific research and development works in demonstration scale, the title of the project is Develop High Mobility Wheeled Platform for special applications (no.

AB High-precision motion systems are being pushed to the limit in terms of speed and accuracy. Although system designs are typically driven by rigidity, performance is deteriorated by the presence of relatively high eigenfrequencies. Philips Innovation Services invests in research how to cope with such system limitations. One of the research projects is called Xtreme Motion. This project aims at developing new methodologies driven by next-generation lithography equipment for 450 mm wafers. A commonly used design procedure is to start with the hardware design using first principles or FEM modelling. As a second step, control strategies are chosen and performance is being evaluated. To obtain a balanced mechatronic design, most likely a number of design iterations will follow. Hence, the hardware designers get feedback how they should improve the hardware design such that better system performance can be obtained. This iterative process will continue until the performance requirements are met. As complexity of high-precision equipment increases, this design process tends to cost more time and effort. For high-precision motion systems, feedforward control is considered to be one of the most important ways to improve servo performance. Therefore, many flavours of feedforward control exist in both theory and practice. As feedforward control and system's dynamics are closely related, there is a two-way dependency in their designs. Therefore it makes sense to steer the system's dynamics using knowledge about the applied control strategies. Besides the typically used eigenfrequency specification, also other specifications could be relevant

AB It is believed that in the near future, drive-by-wire, or even drive-by-wireless, devices will become a standard in the automotive and aeronautic industries. This work presents an innovative drive-by-wire system that allows steering, throttling and braking to be controlled with a single mechatronic device. The complete driving system consists of two symmetrical devices that are virtually coupled to provide bimanual driving capabilities and improved comfort. It also takes advantage of haptic technology to provide the user with an outstanding driving experience. This work describes the design and control algorithms of the developed system, as well as preliminary experiments carried out in a driving simulator to analyze its maneuverability and performance. The results show that users adapt quickly to the proposed system and good performance when comparing it with a wheel-pedal gaming set. © 2013 IEEE.

AB Nowadays, respiratory syndrome represents the most common neonatal pathology. Nevertheless, being respiratory assistance in newborns a great challenge for neonatologists and nurses, use of simulation-based training is quickly becoming a valid meaning of clinical education for an optimal therapy outcome. Commercially available simulators, are, however, not able to represent complex breathing patterns and to evaluate specific alterations. The purpose of this work has been to develop a smart, lightweight, compliant system with variable rigidity able to replicate the anatomical behavior of the neonatal lung, with the final aim to integrate such system into an innovative mechatronic simulator device. A smart material based-system has been proposed and validated

AB The field of "Mechatronics" has changed from being an integrating vehicle for multiple disciplines, into a design philosophy. In the emerging scenario, mechatronics plays one of the key roles in innovative engineering. Because of the integrated multidisciplinary approach, the scope for innovation in product engineering is ever increasing. With rapid changes in technology and more applications becoming real-time and embedded, teaching the mechatronics course only through laboratories or course projects is not sufficient. The leap from the traditional sequential design approach to the mechatronics philosophy is very big. Added to this are the various definitions that have evolved and the various methodologies developed for the mechatronics system design. Mechatronics is at a stage of evolutionary process of modern engineering design and involves systems thinking. "V-cycle" is a prescribed industrial process for mechatronics. It is a graphical construct used to communicate a model-based design and development methodology. If mechatronics system design is accepted as an evolution of engineering design, then a formal perspective design process can be developed and the course delivery can be effective with project based approach. This paper outlines the results of international collaboration between the two institutions on the perception of mechatronics as a modern design philosophy emphasizing team dynamics, project based learning and integration of disciplines. The collaboration was initiated by Indo-US Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE), a US based nonprofit organization promoting quality and collaboration in innovative engineering education. ©American Society for Engineering education, 2013.

AB In this paper, an overall description of the design of an innovative robotic hand developed within the DEXMART project is discussed, with particular attention to the required sensory and actuation subsystem and their integration into the mechanical structure of the hand. The integration of the hand finger, of the sensors and the actuation is reported and the motivations leading to this particular implementation are thoroughly addressed, taking into account both the mechanical constraints and the control requirements. The finger is provided with position, force and tactile sensors and it is actuated by the twisted string actuation system purposely developed for this new robot hand. The effectiveness of the proposed design solutions is preliminary evaluated by showing the performance of the system with closed-loop finger position control. © 2013 IEEE.

AB New innovation demands new technology. At the Division of Fluid and Mechatronic Systems (FLUMES), Linköping University, a novel aircraft conceptual design framework is under development 10 . It consists of Tango and RAPID (Robust Aircraft Parametric Interactive Design). RAPID and Tango are knowledge based aircraft conceptual design tools being developed in CATIA and Matlab respectively. The framework also attempts to address one tool or one database concept. In order to maintain flexibility and allow the developer to choose his or her preferred work method, both programs should be implemented in parallel. Switching between the two should be possible at any time 10 . The work presented in this paper is a part of RAPID and explores the methodology and proposes one of the ways of designing a parametric, reusable and automated fairing, flat and curved panel windshield with a focus on the visibility of a pilot for conceptual design. Flat panel has always demonstrated a challenging integration with the fuselage and its adjoining blend with the cockpit. The critical design integration region has also been proposed to easily blend it with the fuselage in the form of automated parametric CAD template. The fairing design provides a flexible template which can be used for various fuselage and wing configurations for transport aircrafts. The design captures one of the most essential parts of the windshield i.e. visibility criteria and stores it in the form of high level CAD templates. These templates in CATIA V5 form the very backbone to create both flat and curved windshields. The design user interface is the set of simple and logically named parameters in the product tree. The windshield designs created using this automated CAD model are then compared with the existing windshield designs by changing the parameters. CAD automation in CATIA V5 is done by using Engineering Knowledge Language (EKL) for knowledge pattern (KP) and Visual Basic Script for power-copy (PC) through Visual basic application (VBA). EKL and VBA are used to develop the design methodology and object oriented scripting for windshield design, fairings and cockpit integration parts. Apart from putting forward design methodology and automation methods, these two automation methods are compared to their performance in terms of time. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

AB This paper presents a case study of integrating a service learning project into an undergraduate Mechatronics engineering course titled 'Building Automation' for the first time at the Hashemite University in Jordan. The project requires students to visit hospitals to learn about a variety of building systems that they have come across during their course lectures. After grasping the operating principles of building systems available in hospitals, students are required to brainstorm and suggest innovative ideas on how to reduce energy consumption based on tips and hints provided by the instructor and specialized consultants in the field of energy. Students achievement in this project was obtained, through their academic supervisor, their energy consultants, their community partners (hospital personnel), and students reflection on their experience. This paper presents qualitative analysis of integrating service learning and civic engagement in this course, explained the benefits, challenges, and recommendations for future implementation. © 2013 IEEE.

AB In this paper an innovative procedure for determining the optimal design of an external spur gear pump for a particular emission reduction application in automobiles has been proposed. The pump forms the main part of a mechatronic system that controls the flow rate of a mixture of urea in water to catalytically reduce emissions in diesel engines. The proposed research proves to be an advance in gear machine design by using a multi-objective based genetic algorithm, to determine the optimal design of the gears and the casing by maximizing the volumetric efficiency, minimizing pressure overshoots, localized cavitation and noise emissions. The research uses HYGESim (HYdraulic GEar machines Simulator) simulation tool, which is being developed by the authors' research group, for calculating the important performance features of the machine. The best designs for the machine based on enhancement in performance are presented. Results in terms of simulations and tests which validate the effectiveness of the proposed novel design methodology are also presented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The product race has become an innovation race, reconciling challenges of branding, performance, time to market and competitive pricing while complying with ecological, safety and legislation constraints. The answer lies in "smart" products of high complexity, relying on heterogeneous technologies and involving active components. To keep pace with this evolution and further accelerate the design cycle, the design engineering process must be rethought. The paper presents a mechatronic simulation approach to achieve this goal. The starting point is the current virtual prototyping paradigm that is widely adopted and that continues to improve in terms of model complexity, accuracy, robustness and automated optimization. Two evolutions are discussed. A first one is the extension to multi-physics simulation answering the design needs of the inherent multi-disciplinarity of "intelligent" products. Integration of thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, haptic and electrical functions requires simulation to extend beyond the traditional CAD-FEM approach, supporting the use of system, functional and perception models. The second evolution is the integration of control functions in the products. Where current industrial practice treats mechanical system design and control design as different design loops, this paper discusses their integration in a model-based design process at all design stages, turning concepts such as software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop into basic elements of an industrial design approach. These concepts are illustrated by a number of automotive design engineering cases, which demonstrate that the combined use of perception, geometric and system models allows to develop innovative solutions for the active safety, low-emission and high-comfort performance of next-generation vehicles. This process in turn poses new challenges to the design in terms of the specification and validation of such innovative products, including their failure modes and fault-tolerant behaviour. This will imply adopting a model-based system engineering approach that is currently already common practice in software engineering. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB An active hydromagnetic journal bearing is designed and presented in this study, which is a new and innovative type of hybrid journal bearing. The proposed new mechatronic smart device has a common bearing shell that contains the two parts of the bearing, which is an attempt to combine the advantages of both types of bearings to overcome their drawbacks and give rise to new possibilities for instability control, increased load-carrying capacity, diagnostics of the rotor system, etc. The active hydromagnetic journal bearing should operate as either a hydrodynamic, active magnetic or hybrid journal bearing, depending on the needs of the rotating machinery. The hydrodynamic lubrication is developed in the inner bearing surface, and the electromagnets of the magnetic bearing are placed outside its outer surface. The active hydromagnetic journal bearing is designed with the appropriate clearance, so that both the hydrodynamic and magnetic bearings can operate. The suitable operational regions for the active hydromagnetic journal bearing are calculated and presented as a combination of the optimum ratio between the air gap and the clearance. Additionally, a simulation code using the two-dimensional finite element method (ANSYS) is developed to simulate the performance of the magnetic component of the active hydromagnetic journal bearing, and the ANSYS software is used to obtain a solution for the hydrodynamic pressure field. The dynamic characteristics of the hybrid journal bearing in terms of the stiffness and damping coefficients versus the Sommerfeld number are calculated and presented. In the hybrid bearing operation, the corresponding stiffness and damping coefficients are used to simulate the hydromagnetic bearing dynamic behaviour. Each hybrid coefficient consists of two parts; the hydrodynamic and the magnetic part. When the operation is purely hydrodynamic, the magnetic parts of the dynamic coefficients are zero and vice versa, whereas both parts are present in the hybrid operation mode. © IMechE 2013.

AB This paper describes the design features of an innovative fully integrated camera candidate for mini-invasive abdominal surgery with single port or transluminal access. The apparatus includes a CMOS imaging sensor, a light-emitting diode (LED)-based unit for scene illumination, a photodiode for luminance detection, an optical system designed according to the mechanical compensation paradigm, an actuation unit for enabling autofocus and optical zoom, and a control logics based on microcontroller. The bulk of the apparatus is characterized by a tubular shape with a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 35 mm. The optical system, composed of four lens groups, of which two are mobile, has a total length of 13.46 mm and an effective focal length ranging from 1.61 to 4.44 mm with a zoom factor of 2.75×, with a corresponding angular field of view ranging from 16° to 40°. The mechatronics unit, devoted to move the zoom and the focus lens groups, is implemented adopting miniature piezoelectric motors. The control logics implements a closed-loop mechanism, between the LEDs and photodiode, to attain automatic control light. Bottlenecks of the design and some potential issues of the realization are discussed. A potential clinical scenario is introduced. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB The goal of machine tools for Ultra High Precision Machining is to guarantee high specified performances and to maintain them over life cycle time. In this paper the design of an innovative mechatronic subsystem (platform) for Active Vibration Control (AVC) of Ultra High Precision micromilling Machines is presented. The platform integrates piezoelectric stack actuators and a novel sensor concept. During the machining process (e.g. milling), the contact between the cutting tool and the workpiece surface at the tool tip point generates chattering vibrations. Any vibration is recorded on the workpiece surface, directly affecting its roughness. Consequently, uncontrolled vibrations lead to poor surface finishing, unacceptable in high precision milling. The proposed Smart Platform aims to improve the surface finishing of the workpiece exploiting a broadband AVC strategy. The paper describes the steps throughout the design phase of the platform, beginning from the actuator/sensor criteria selection taking into account both performance and durability. The novel actuation principle and mechanism and the related FE analysis are also presented. Finally, an integrated mechatronic model able to predict in closed-loop the active damping and vibration-suppression capability of the integrated system is presented and simulation results are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Software is expected to become the dominant driver for innovation for the next generation of advanced distributed embedded real-time systems (advanced mechatronic systems). Software will build communities of autonomous agents at runtime which exploit local and global networking to enhance and optimize their functionality leading to self-adaptation or self-optimization. However, current development techniques are not capable of providing the safety guarantees required for this class of systems. Our approach, MechatronicUML, addresses the outlined challenge by proposing a coherent and integrated model-driven development approach which supports the modeling and verification of safety guarantees for systems with reconfiguration of software components at runtime. Modeling is based on a syntactically and semantically rigorously defined and partially refined subset of UML. Verification is based on a special type of decomposition and compositional model checking to make it scalable. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB Within the development of mechatronic systems the used manufacturing and assembly technologies determine the product concept. Otherwise require innovative products the development of new production technologies. Against this background product and production system have to be developed in a close interplay from the beginning. The present paper describes the conceptual design of a production system on the basis of the according product concept. This reduces cost and time consuming iteration loops during the development process.

AB In response to the rapid growth of online teaching and learning, University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) has been developing a number of remotely accessible laboratories. In this paper, we present our newly developed remote lab robotic rig that uniquely addresses challenges in Mechatronic courses. The rig contains a mobile robotic platform equipped with various sensory modules placed in a maze with a pantograph power system enabling continuous use of the platform. The software architecture employed allows users to develop their simulations using the Player/Stage simulator and subsequently upload the code in the robotic rig for real-time testing. This paper presents the motivation, design concepts and analysis of students' feedback responses to their use of the remote lab robotics rig. Survey results of a pilot study shows the participants highly agreeing that the remote lab contributes to, "deeper understanding of the subject matter", "flexible learning process" and "inspire research in robotics". © 2013 IEEE.

AB The article presents a mechatronic system for the production of highly secured documents that allows for the realization of R&D tasks directed at the improvement of the level of security of electronic and physical RFID tags. The structure of the system allows for the application of special, low cost, flexible production systems enabling free use of developed innovative technologies, structures, components, formulas and procedures. The system is based on two technological lines. The first of them enables the manufacture of multilayer (glued), graphically and electronically non-personalised products that vary in size and shapes in the conditions of low cost experimental production. The second line allows for the introduction of unique graphic information in form of overprints assigned to suitable data entered into the microprocessor memory. Adequate verification systems compare the compatibility of the electronic record with the alphanumeric information and the conformity of digital graphics with the graphics in form of the overprint visible in certain lighting conditions. The additional application of the two-sided lamination results in the increased mechanical and physical endurance and resistance to non-authorised changes of graphic and alphanumerical information. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB An essential task in today's engineering is to realize a multifunctional design which needs an optimization process to achieve highest performance (load profile), minimized energy consumption (fuel, gas, electricity in production and life time of product) and maximized sustainability (during entire life cycle from idea to end of life) at an affordable prize in combination. Another point is that the performance of products is increased steadily up to now, which shifts the load profile towards higher peak loads. Consequently, a related design methodology is necessary which takes into account modern techniques of CAD (Computer Aided Design) and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) besides analytical engineering calculation and testing. Also the inclusion of nontechnical aspects must be possible (e.g. experience, rating of economy). Besides this the local stressing, time dependency and non-linear behavior must be considered in more detail; examples are proposed below. This methodology can be illustrated very well for the example of screw joints in products with high mechanical loading between components. Established technical literature mainly refers to pure technical aspects of bolted joints, e.g. [1, 2, 3]. Another important aspect for modern products is the increased use of mechatronic functions (mechanical system added by sensors, actuators and controller as well as controlling software). These functions raise the variety of failure modes significantly, which requires improved reliability. The paper describes, how screw joints are affected, because the number of screw joints increases and that engineers have to use reliable design methods to develop robust products. Looking to the packaging of mechatronic products, smaller screws joints are used because of space restrictions coming from the high number of components. In the end this means higher stressing of smaller screws. Countersunk heads offer benefits regarding space requirements, but need to consider positioning tolerances. For optimization process always non-linear relations are challenging; they need special description of the mechanisms and increase the demand for quality of the optimization method (e.g. convergence of numerical methods). Conclusions from this result in fastening perspectives for the design of innovative products for the future (automation of engineering design for fast product development considering complex interactions).

It integrates the power switch with the control circuitry and the diagnostics; with respect to the state of the art, new functionalities are integrated such as full reverse polarity protection and programmable output slope control against in-rush currents and current spike transients. The paper will discuss the driver IC design from the choice of the architecture to the real silicon implementation. The proposed innovative RCD has been implemented in a 0.35 μm HV-CMOS technology and has been embedded in a mechatronic brush-holder regulator system-on-chip for an automotive alternator. The simulation results and experimental measurements prove the effectiveness of the proposed RCD facing the harshest automotive conditions. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Current day, mechatronic systems are designed with synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics and computer technology to produce intelligent devices for the purposes of solving real-world problems. This requires that a mechatronic system must be robust and fault tolerant, i.e. it should have the ability to process incomplete, imprecise or uncertain information. Moreover, such systems often have to work in collaborative environments while being subjected to unknown inputs and yet adhering to strict safety norms. Examples are not restricted to production lines, but extend to extremely safety critical systems such as space and underwater robotics, autonomous transportation systems, aviation systems and medical robots. This theme discusses the fundamentals of designing such systems from the first principles and then how to embed intelligence into them. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers. All Rights Reserved.

AB Even though the concept development phase in product development is arguably the most important phase in mechanical and mechatronics design, the available computer-based support for this stage is marginal. This paper presents a new computational model-based method to improve the early phases of mechatronic product design and to facilitate the application from early designs to detailed designs. The paper focuses on model-based Function-Behavior- Structure (FBS) libraries in SysML to support both the manual and computational generation of standard and innovative concepts. In this paper, an approach to re-usable functional models in SysML is presented. The method uses an operator-flow formulation of functions, based on the NIST functional basis, and is validated against a model of an electric car. The generated functional models are validated with respect to the consistency of the flows and tested by associating the functional model directly to the target product component structure. The results of the research are a new modeling approach for function and component libraries in SysML, an associated workflow for modeling of mechatronic systems, and the necessary extensions of the NIST functional basis. The modeling approach provides means for formal functional decomposition followed by an allocation of the functions to structural components that form the target structure. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

AB In this paper, an innovative sensor for the control of a tendon-driven mechatronic system is presented. The proposed sensor measures the tendon tension using optoelectronic components properly selected and mounted on a suitably designed compliant frame. This solution presents several advantages mainly in terms of simplicity and compactness with respect to force sensors based on strain-gauge or Bragg-grating. By exploiting the properties of optoelectronic components with a narrow angle of view and by means of a very simple conditioning electronics, the very small deformation of the compliant frame caused by the tendon force can be measured. Moreover, the compliant frame has been designed to allow the sensor to be mounted in any position along the tendon. The sensor working principle, an optimal design procedure and the results of an experimental testbench where two of the proposed sensors are used for the feedback control of a tendon-driven mechatronic system are reported in the paper. The experimental verification of a contact force estimation algorithm useful for grasping and manipulation purposes in which the data collected by the optoelectronic tendon force sensors are exploited is also reported in the paper. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a hierarchical hyprid planning approach developed for realizing self-optimizing mechatronic systems. The hybrid planning approach is based on a discrete plan and a forecast of continuous system behavior generated by simulation during runtime. This does not only allow an online adaptation of a previously generated plan with regard to the actual system state as well as the current environmental conditions, even the planning objectives may be adapted to newly arising needs during system operation. The planner exploits the hierarchy already present in the system model by considering hierarchical parameterizations of the system as a discrete dimension of choice. The parameterizations are proposed by a novel hierarchical multiobjective optimization, which calculates Pareto points in a bottom up fashion, taking into account the constraints imposed by lower levels of the system hierarchy on the higher ones. Evaluations of the hierarchical hybrid planner in the context of an innovative railbound transport system show that it outperforms its non-hierarchical predecessor. © 2012 IEEE.

AB When designing complex mechatronic systems, a team of developers will be facing many challenges that can impede progress and innovation if not tackled properly. In meeting them simulation tools play a central role. Yet it is often impossible for a single developer to foresee the overall impact a design decision will have on the system and on the other domains involved. For this task multi-domain simulation tools exists, but because of its complexity and the different levels of detail that are needed, the effort to specify a complete system from scratch is very high. Another challenge is the selection of the most suitable solution elements provided by the manufacturers. Currently they are often chosen manually from catalogues. The development engineer is therefore usually inclined to employ well-known solution elements and suppliers. To tackle both challenges our aim is an increase in efficiency and innovation by means of generally available solution knowledge, such as well-proven solution patterns, ready-to-use solution elements, and established simulation models [1]. Our paper presents a tool-supported, sequential design process. From the outset, the comprehensive functional capability of the designed system is supervised by means of multi-domain simulation. At significant points in the design process, solution knowledge can be accessed as it is stored in ontologies and therefore available via Semantic Web [2]. Thus, one can overcome barriers resulting from different terminologies or referential systems and furthermore infer further knowledge from the stored knowledge. The paper focuses on an early testing in the conceptual design stage and on the subsequent semantic search for suitable solution elements. After the specification of a principle solution for the mechatronic system by combining solution patterns, an initial multi-domain model of the system is created. This is done on the basis of the active structure and of idealized simulation models which are part of a free library and associated with the chosen solution patterns via the ontologies. In further designing the controlled system and its parameters with the completed model, the developer defines additional criteria to be fed into the subsequent semantic search for solution elements. Information on the latter is provided by the manufacturers as well as detailed simulation models, which are used to analyze the functional capability of the concretized system. Therefore, the corresponding idealized models are replaced automatically with the parameterized models of the solution elements containing for example the specific friction model for the chosen motor. We show this process using the concrete example of a dough-production system. In particular, we focus on its transport system. Resulting requirements for the simulation models and their level of detail are expound, as well as the architecture and benefits of the ontologies. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

AB Teaching classical controls systems design to mechanical engineering students presents unique challenges. While most mechanical engineering programs prepare students to be wellversed in the application of physical principles and modeling aspects of physical systems, implementation of closed loop control and system-level analysis is lagging. It is not uncommon that students report difficulty in conceptualizing even common controls systems terms such as steady-state error and disturbance rejection. Typically, most courses focus on the theoretical analysis and modeling, but students are left asking the questions... How do I implement a phase-lead compensator? ...What is a non-minimum phase system? This paper presents an innovative approach in teaching control systems design course based on the use of a low-cost apparatus that has the ability to directly communicate with MATLAB and its Simulink toolbox, allowing students to drag-and-drop controllers and immediately test their effect on the response of the physical plant. The setup consists of a DC micro-motor driving a propeller attached to a carbon-fiber rod. The angular displacement of the rod is measured with an analog potentiometer, which acts as the pivot point for the carbon fiber rod. The miniature circuit board is powered by the USB port of a laptop and communicates to the host computer using the a virtual COM port. MATLAB/Simulink communicates to the board using its serial port read/write blocks to command the motor and detect the deflection angle. This presentation describes a typical semester-long experimental protocol facilitated by the low-cost kit. The kit allows demonstration of classical PID, phase lead and lag controllers, as well as non-linear feedback linearization techniques. Comparison between student gains before and after the introduction of the mechatronic kits are also provided. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

The current challenges in this area include the design of micro UAV systems that are capable of precise delivery, minimum volume and lower cost. This paper examines the use innovative techniques such as of axiomatic design, TRIZ (theory of inventive problem solving) and Hardware in the loop to arrive at a systematic design process. Virtual product design procedures involving simulation of complex systems allows designers to develop system without finalizing the hardware. The simulation procedure can be as what if scenario when the hardware doesn't exist. Virtual simulations enable everyone to work on development before the first prototype is completed. Engineers can validate the entire operating cycle for the machine by driving the simulation with control system logic and timing. Given the small volume available when in launch configuration, the primary driving parameters were maximizing available wing area and relative wing effectiveness, while minimizing the required storage volume. The impact of G-forces on the structural viability, mechanical complexity and overall system survivability are important in determining the relative merit of the design concepts. This paper also addresses some of the practical applications, advantages and difficulties associated with the engineering applications of virtual reality. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

AB Development of high speed railway for commercial speed beyond the limit of 350km/h involves an accurate testing of on board subsystems. In particular, many safety relevant subsystems like odometry algorithms, wheel slide protection devices (WSP) and anti-skid controls are influenced by wheel-rail adhesion conditions. The verification of these different devices necessary requires a deep testing activity. Usually, the testing activity consists of quite complex experimental tests mainly required by the technological improvements and the integration of different on board subsystems (braking, traction, signaling), the mutual interaction of which has to be carefully evaluated. Therefore, a wide use of railway vehicle roller rig for testing activities has been introduced. One of the most advanced testing device of Firenze Osmannoro is an innovative full scale roller rig with the aim of reproducing degraded adhesion conditions and testing both traction and braking equipment at high speed (over 300km/h). Innovative features are related to the simulation of degraded adhesion conditions since, on conventional roller rigs [1], sliding has to be limited in order to avoid a significant wear or damage of both rolling surfaces (vehicle and rig). In the paper the authors will present a numerical model of the HIL roller rig system, inspired to the Osmannoro Research Center, using Software In the Loop (SIL) approach. This approach can be defined simulated HIL (sHIL) approach since the simulated system has the same architecture of the HIL system but all the components will be completely simulated. The objectives of the authors, by means of the sHIL approach, will be the analysis of the controller performance and the dynamical effects on the roller-rig for different adhesion conditions both in case of traction and in case of braking, taking into account the influence of the safety on board systems (WSP and Antiskid). A particular attention will be given to stability and robustness issues arising from the complex interactions between the different mechatronic subsystems.

AB The main goal of this article is to present the design, technical development, and preliminary validation of an innovative mechatronic device for force/torque measurements taken from the human foot using pilot data. The device, formed by a mobile platform equipped with two six-axis force/torque sensors, was used to perform accurate quantitative measurements during isometric exercises, aimed at performing functional assessment tests in poststroke patients undergoing a rehabilitation treatment. Results from pilot data provide a validation of the device. A large clinical trial has been planned to test whether the platform can be used in the clinical practice. We suggest that measurements of ground reaction forces taken from the foot of poststroke patients during the initiation of activities of daily living tasks can provide information about their motor recovery and enlighten possible areas of application, ranging from isometric motor exercise in neurorehabilitation to foot-based human-machine interface.

AB Due to the synergistic nature of mechanical engineering, electronic control and systematical thinking [1], the mechatronics education is regarded as a complicated and more demanding course characterized by the need of highly integrated ability with theoretical knowledge and hands-on experiment to solve proposed problems, and thus has drawn great attention worldwide. As one of the typical and innovative teaching modes in mechatronics in China, mechatronics teaching in Beihang University has formed a "One main line, Two links, Three practical points" mode and methodology, which emphasizes on the links and mapping relationships between theoretical teaching and practical teaching. After 6-year practicing and exploring, the course has made fundamental and systematic innovation achievements in the field with respect to class materials, teaching mode, teaching system. Several typical mechatronics projects proposed and achieved by students have verified the effect and innovation of the project based teaching mode and methodology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There has been an increasing interest in the use of mechanical dynamics, (e.g., assive, Elastic, And viscous dynamics) for energy efficient and agile control of robotic systems. Despite the impressive demonstrations of behavioural performance, The mechanical dynamics of this class of robotic systems is still very limited as compared to those of biological systems. For example, Passive dynamic walkers are not capable of generating joint torques to compensate for disturbances from complex environments. In order to tackle such a discrepancy between biological and artificial systems, We present the concept and design of an adaptive clutch mechanism that discretely covers the full-range of dynamics. As a result, The system is capable of a large variety of joint operations, including dynamic switching among passive, actuated and rigid modes. The main innovation of this paper is the framework and algorithm developed for controlling the trajectory of such joint. We present different control strategies that exploit passive dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in motion control with respect to the speed of motion and energy efficiency. The actuator is implemented in a simple pendulum platform to quantitatively evaluate this novel approach.

AB Innovation in today's mechanical systems is often only possible due to the embedded software. Particularly, the software connects previously isolated systems resulting in, so-called, advanced mechatronic systems. Mechatronic systems are often employed in a safety-critical context, where hazards that are caused by faults in the software have to be prevented. Preferably, this is achieved by already avoiding these faults during development. A major source of faults is the complex coordination between the connected mechatronic systems. In this paper, we present Real-Time Coordination Patterns for advanced mechatronic systems. These patterns formalize proven communication protocols for the coordination between mechatronic systems as reusable entities. Furthermore, our approach exploits the patterns in the decomposition of the system to enable a scalable formal verification for the detection of faults. We illustrate the patterns with examples from different case studies. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB The paper presents a brief overview of the projects integrating the development of ICTs with the rehabilitation system for people with risk of fall that are solved under the Ambient Assistive Technology (AAL) programme. The paper includes description of our concept of the diagnostic and rehabilitation system with preventative features to decrease the risks of fall and its consequences in elderly. It integrates functions of two systems developed within the two research projects MonAMI (6FP) and SMILING (7FP) where we participated. The main goal is to ensure higher safety for seniors who are in risk of falls and are living alone. The first module of the integrated rehabilitation system is aimed to identification of falls and emergency communication system for the households of elderly living alone. The platform for that is system developed under the 6FP - MonAMI. The second module of the diagnostic and rehabilitation system plays a preventive role as a home rehabilitation device used for regular training of gait during daily activities. The device is based on an innovation of the motorized mechatronic shoe TUKE developed under the 7FP project SMILING. Users train their walk ability during performance of everyday tasks while solving unexpected perturbations simulating influence of external environment by surmounting the uncertainty when stepping on. The complex system is undertaking the challenge to come in market where we see an absence of preventive, diagnostic-rehabilitation centers aimed on people (elderly) with risk of fall. The end users will be rehabilitation clinics, geriatric centers, social services and condition centers, but preferably individual users, mostly seniors. © 2012 IEEE.

AB A new contact-less transport system for thin and fragile products like silicon wafers is introduced. The product is carried on a thin film of air separating the product from the system, and is transported using the relative velocity of the pressurized and moving air film parallel and adjacent to the system surface. This innovative concept can produce both the high stiffness and acceleration required for high precision positioning and efficient product transport. In this paper the basic design principles of this system are presented. Experimental verification is demonstrated on a 6-dof planar air actuated high precision positioning stage. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Mechatronic systems are based on the close interaction of several engineering domains and are characterized by a high complexity; the assurance of their reliability is therefore very challenging. Established reliability methods are typically conducted on detailed system designs. As a consequence, a great number of failures are first recognized very late in the product engineering process.

AB High speed drive systems are often described at an operating point above the critical speed. Therefore, the resonance frequencies have to be passed twice (start up / run down). In the worst case, the strong vibrations at critical speeds can lead to self-destruction. Unbalanced rotors are the main cause for the self-excited vibrations. Over the past years, the focus of investigations [1] was laid on the improvement of the operating characteristics by using passive elements to guarantee stability of the system. However, the transition through the critical speed is still an unwanted high mechanical strain. In this paper, an innovative concept for rotary drives will be presented, which is able to compensate excessive vibrations or deflections actively. A permanent magnet excited synchronous motor (PMSM), which is able to generate motor torque and radial force simultaneously [2], with a large air gap is used. The capability of generating a highly dynamic and active control variable for the rotor position opens up new opportunities for drive applications. In this work, many different technical disciplines are combined, creating a truly mechatronic product. © 2012 IEEE.

AB Over the last decade, many courses have been created in the hopes of getting engineering students more excited about innovation and entrepreneurship. While most of these courses have aimed to teach students business acumen, we believe that, under the right circumstances, traditional engineering courses can get students excited in these topics as well. We present Mechanical Engineering 218 Smart Product Design, a graduate-level mechatronics course sequence at Stanford University, as an example of such a class. In this paper, we explore, in detail, the personal, contextual, and interpersonal factors which comprise ME218's enterprising learning ecology. We also highlight some of the immediate and longer-term outcomes of the course, including gains in students' innovation self-confidence and entrepreneurial intentions. © 2012 TEMPUS Publications.

AB Competitiveness to a company is given by innovations. The chassis as main part in vehicle design is incisive to the driving behavior of a car. On the one side, mechanical devices are well-engineered which means differentiation to competitors in mechanical devices is complex and costly. On the other side, improvements due to clients and legislator such as driving dynamics, CO2 reduction, or pedestrian protection increase the requirements to the chassis concerning comfort, safety, handling, or individualization by less cost and maintenance. This balancing act can be done by mechatronics systems which means the interaction of mechanic, electronic, and informatics devices. Basic mechatronics systems are used to assist the driver (e.g., power steering) or to overrule a wrong driver input (e.g., ABS brake). Different from this so-called by-wire systems are extensive mechatronics systems where the vehicle behavior and the driver feedback can be designed independently (there is no mechanical link between input and output). Drive-by-wire, X-by-wire, or simply by-wire technology is already present nowadays. Starting with aeronautics, where fly-by-wire has been used extensively in the Airbus A320 family without mechanical backup. In passenger cars, by-wire functionality and by-wire systems are far more recent, but still already well known (VDI-Bericht 1828, 2004). One can distinguish between by-wire functionality and by-wire system. The by-wire functionality can be reduced to the ability to control or even only apply a force by an electrical signal (through an electrical wire) to the vehicle. The definition by-wire system is that the line between the driver's input interface and the actuation which produces force is partly designed by wire. Hence, in contrast to the by-wire functionality, the system has no permanent hydraulic or mechanic linkage between them. Common advantages of by-wire systems are the freedom in functionality, package integration, reducing variants, design, and enabler for driver assistance functions. In >Sect. 1, these general facts of by-wire systems, the vehicle-driver control loop, and aspects of the input module behavior will be shown. Afterward longitudinal and lateral dynamic systems and their functionality are explained in more detail (>Sects. 2 and >3). One benefit of by-wire systems is the system and functional integration. In >Sect. 4 integrated corner modules are illustrated and analyzed as well as integrated control strategy aspects. The challenge of by-wire systems are the functional safety requirements, especially in terms of availability. The latter is the most important for the OEMs and customers. Any minor failure of the systems, which has to be displayed in the dash board, will reduce the customers' faith in the car. These aspects will be explained in >Sect. 5. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd. 2012. All rights reserved.

AB Self-optimizing mechatronic systems are a new class of technical systems. On the one hand, new challenges regarding dependability arise from their additional complexity and adaptivity. On the other hand, their abilities enable new concepts and methods to improve the dependability of mechatronic systems. This paper introduces a multi-level dependability concept for selfoptimizing mechatronic systems and shows how probabilistic planning can be used to improve the availability and reliability of systems in the operating phase. The general idea to improve the availability of autonomous systems by applying probabilistic planning methods to avoid energy shortages is exemplified on the example of an innovative railway vehicle.

AB Functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis has made major strides in recent years, both because of the development of new scanners and owing to magnetic resonance compatible systems that make it possible to stimulate parts of the human body during analysis. The significant gains in our knowledge of the brain that can thus be achieved justify efforts to construct machines with control circuits suitable for this purpose. This paper presents a magnetic resonance compatible mechatronic device with electropneumatic control that can be used to move one or both feet during functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the cerebral motor zones. The system is innovative and original. The results obtained at the end of the investigation were good, and demonstrated that the design is feasible. © IMechE 2011.

The outstanding dynamics of the tool enable a highly dynamic depth of cut variation during the cutting process. Unlike commercial technologies, such as ultrasonic tools, the presented device does not oscillate in resonance, but controlled. Its first natural resonance frequency of ?0 > 4.5 kHz and its capability to provide a maximum amplitude of &UTRI;lmax > 30 microns establish the basis to cut micro patterns, while using process parameters applied in real-life industrial processes. © 2012 The Authors.

AB Vibration control is gaining an increasing competitive advantage in machine tool design. In particular for Ultra High Precision Machining, the goal of machine tool design is to guarantee high accuracy, specified performances, and to maintain them over life cycle time. Micromilling operations have to generate outputs characterized by very close tolerances, high precision and surface finishing. During the machining process (e.g. milling), the contact between the cutting tool and the work- piece surface at the tool tip point generates chattering vibrations. Any vibration is recorded on the workpiece surface, directly affecting its roughness, which leads to poor surface finishing, unacceptable in high precision milling. In this paper the active vibration control of an innovative mechatronic subsystem (Smart Platform), which can be installed, in a modular way within ultra high precision micromilling machines is presented. The smart platform includes two main parts

AB In 2007, the University of Hartford College of Engineering, Technology, and Architecture, in West Hartford, Connecticut began a partnership with the Faculty of Engineering at the Herat University, in Herat City, Afghanistan. The goals of the project were to use a combination of curriculum revision and improvement, faculty development, distance learning and collaborative projects, and local/internal partnerships to establish Herat University Faculty of Engineering as the preeminent Engineering program for Western Afghanistan. Once part of Kabul University, the Faculty of Engineering became a permanent part of Herat University in 2002. After functioning in Kabul for approximately 20 years, the Engineering program was closed following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. The program temporarily relocated to Pakistan in the 1990s and then to Herat in 1995. Although the university was officially open in Herat City during the five years of Taliban rule, programming and resources were extremely limited. Many of those constraints still remain in place as the Afghan government seeks to rebuild Afghanistan's Higher Education System. The partnership between the University of Hartford (UH) and Herat University (HU) was accepted for funding by the World Bank in 2006. Before the partnership began, engineering instructors at HU had bachelor's degrees only with extremely limited opportunities for graduate study or professional development, including technology in the classroom, pedagogical innovations, and student-centered learning. Since the partnership began in 2007, a total of 17 instructors from Herat University pursued their masters' degrees in different disciplines of engineering at the University of Hartford. In addition to their coursework leading to a master's degree, they shadowed UH instructors and through this mentoring, they learned technological applications available and are installed at HU via the World Bank and USAID funding. They developed and updated, student-centered course materials, assessment methodologies, and plans for continuing education and professional development strategies. A number of the instructors also have implemented the Mechatronics and Architecture programs. These two curriculum areas have been developed collaboratively by HU and UH, and began admitting students in 2010. This paper will address the key successes achieved as well as the challenges encountered in developing a robust partnership between universities in countries with such different histories, cultures, educational philosophies, and resources. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB Radical changes in the engineering programs at the University of Denver came in 1996 with the advent of ABET EC2000. Prior to EC2000, the engineering programs were developed based on the experience of faculty, the numbers of students and faculty, laboratory resources necessary to deliver the programs, and the accreditation requirements. As disciplinary programs evolved from a general engineering program and the number of students was low, this was a difficult process under the old ABET Criteria; the new ABET Criteria gave opportunities to design unique programs. New curricula were developed in 1996 along with an assessment process that took into account the needs of constituencies. Since then, the programs, assessment processes, as well as the process of determining the needs of constituencies have evolved substantially. Ethics has evolved from half of a course shared with engineering economic to ethics throughout the curricula; engineering economics has evolved into a full course for the BSME program, and an engineering entrepreneurship course for the BSEE and BSCpE programs; a legal studies course is required in the BSEE and BSCpE curricula; an option in Mechatronics Systems Engineering has been added to the BSEE program; and 5 year dual degree programs have been created that combine BS and MS degrees. © 2011 IEEE.

AB During the product development process a lot of challenges have to be mastered. Beside ever shorter innovation cycles and time-to-market, products with increasing complexity such as mechatronic products lead to greater development risks. Mechatronic products are characterized by high functional as well as physical (e.g. spatial) integration. This integration of several modules (sub-systems) from different engineering disciplines entails a high risk of product failures. It is therefore crucial to systematically identify these risks already in early design stages. Therefore, it is important to realize that systems (sub-systems, system-elements, modules) are carriers of different physical effects. These effects not only realize the function of the system, but may sometimes have also undesired side effects which may lead to problems for other modules and, hence, have to be considered carefully. In this paper, the IFMEA (Integration Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) method is introduced, which is based on the widespread FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) method, but has its focus on identifying problems due to the integration of several modules within mechatronic systems.

AB Nowadays, as mechatronic and electronic systems have found their way into vehicles, the technological knowledgebase of traditional remanufacturing companies erodes rapidly and even the industrial principle of remanufacturing is at risk. Due to the fact that modern cars incorporate up to 80 of these mechatronic and electronic systems that are communicating with each other e.g. via the vehicle controller area network (CAN), remanufacturing of these automotive systems requires innovative reverse engineering knowhow, methodological innovations and new technologies, especially focusing on the tasks testing and diagnostics of systems and their subassemblies. The European research project "CAN REMAN", conducted by Bayreuth University in cooperation with two other universities and eight industrial partners, focuses on these needs in order to enable companies to remanufacture modern automotive mechatronics and electronics with innovative reverse engineering skills as well as to develop appropriate and affordable testing and diagnostics technologies. In order to operate and test the mechatronic device with CAN interface outside the vehicle environment, an appropriate simulation of the vehicle network and all connected sensors of the device under test (DUT) is essential. This implies an electrical analysis of the connectors of the DUT, a content-related analysis of the CAN-bus, a sensor hardware simulation and a CAN-bus simulation. All electrical measurements and results were taken using conventional multimeters or oscilloscopes. The CAN-bus analysis and simulations were conducted using the Vector Informatics software tool "CANoe" (Version 7.1) and a suitable CAN-bus hardware, e.g. the CANcardXL and the IOcab8444opto. All hardware simulations were executed with a conventional wave form generator or a microcontroller evaluation board (Olimex AVR-CAN) and an appropriate electric setup. In order to initially readout the failure memory and to investigate the diagnostic communication of the DUT, garage testers such as "Bosch KTS 650" or "Rosstech VAG-COM" were used. The results of the project are application-orientated methods, test benches and skills for remanufacturing companies to find out the working principles of the CAN-bus communication between automotive mechatronic and electronic systems within vehicles. The knowhow presented in this article enables remanufacturing companies to remanufacture modern automotive mechatronic and electronic systems which are communicating via the CAN-bus and similar communication types. © 2011, Freiberger et al; licensee Springer.

AB Mechatronics design is about integration of mechanics, electronics and software. As new functionality in products is realized to a large extent through integration of mechanics, electronics and software the need for knowledge integration between these disciplines becomes central. Thus, the innovation and product development process has to be able to cope with low and high degrees of innovativeness in the same organization, for the same portfolio. After a brief wrap-up of recent concepts of innovation processes, the authors describe the specific characteristics of mechatronics design. Using the "degree of innovativeness" a key tailoring criterion, the authors will show how the existing and proven concept of idea management and innovation processes proposed by Thom as well as the staged-gate process proposed by Cooper have to be expanded to support mechatronic systems design and development. In the end, using this approach the development of a new product, an electro-hydraulic compact axis, is briefly sketched within the context of the proposed process.

AB The continuously integration of electrics and electronics (EE) in the last decades is one of the main key drivers for innovation and business success of the Automotive OEMs. This is also applicable for truck manufacturers. On the other side factors like the rising vehicle complexity, number of variants and the warranty costs for EE issues are increasing the pressure on the engineering teams responsible for the mechatronic systems. To address these issues one of the key activities in the European market (focus on Germany) during the last decade was to introduce industry-wide standards for the data transfer of wiring harness data between OEM and harness supplier. In this paper the benefits and technical background of using the standards KBL and KOMP formats within the MB-Trucks brand will be presented. Moreover the role of the Information Technology (IT) will be explained in detail. For practical commercial vehicle application examples, some requirements like the impact of commercial vehicle huge variation (see Fig.1) are shown. The influence of different IT strategies on worldwide data availability, electrical component supplier integration and global reuse of electrical component or design results between business units are explained as well as expectations on the future development of the wiring harness data standards. During 2011 the next generation of data standard format VEC (Vehicle Electric Container) will be presented in the European market and the related benefits will also be analyzed.

New product development procedures, especially in automotive, aerospace, industries today deploy increasingly sophisticated solutions to streamline and speed up product development as well as to improve overall product quality. With new digital factory layout tools and improved 3-D visualizations, manufacturers can digitally design and validate full factories in up to half the time previously required to do the job. Virtual product design procedures involving simulation of complex systems allows designers to develop system without finalizing the hardware. The simulation procedure can be as -what if? scenario when the hardware doesn't exist. There are two critical issues to consider

AB This paper presents an innovative river discharge monitoring system which uses a horizontal acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP) attached to a mechatronic system that provides vertical motion to different depths. Also, an extended index velocity method is developed which utilises velocity measurements from different depths to achieve more accurate discharge calculation under complex flow conditions. The prototype system was developed and installed near the estuaries of a river where backwater and tidal motion was known to be present due to small distance and altitude difference from the sea. Five experiments were performed, and in two experiments the proposed method performed roughly the same as the standard index velocity method. In the other three experiments the proposed method performed much better and the difference between the discharges was as large as 10%. The results indicate that a vertically moving H-ADCP can be used to calculate river discharge more accurately in complex flow environments. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The new long-distance double-decker trains FV DOSTO of SBB will be equipped with the roll compensation system BOMBAR-DIER * FLEXX * Tronic WAKO * . This System allows to rise the trains speed in curves by around 15 %. The roll compensation system is an innovative mechatronic tilting system. Mechanically FLEXX Tronic WAKO has inwardly inclined links of the anti roll bar to realize a fictitious high-lying roll center. The mechanical fail-safe architecture as well as the extended redundancy concept allows higher performance with higher reliability and availability. The solution achieved requires less space, weight and leads to lower costs. For verification and validation of the functionality and performance, the new bogie was tested under real operation conditions with an original IC-2000-car for 7 months on about 40000 km. After the commissioning, optimization and the homologation runs with the test vehicles with the FLEXX Tronic WAKO system, test runs have been carried out with passengers. A total of 450 subjects were interviewed with a questionnaire regarding vibration comfort and well-being. Demonstration runs confirmed a travel time of less than 54 minutes between Lausanne and Bern and the calculations model for speed profile W could be verified. In addition the active radial steering and stability control system FLEXX Tronic ARS has been tested successfully, to demonstrate the effectiveness of minimization of the wheel/rail forces to an absolute minimum.

AB High Efficient CAD/CAE software is one of the most important tools in research and development of modern complex equipments. However, there exists a lots of 3D CAD/CAE softwares for the general equipments/products design and simulation in the commercial market. But for the concrete high-performance build-up mechatronic systems, especially with extremely high requirements on the dynamics characteristics, there has a lot of repeatable works to be carried manually on all kinds of simulations during product developing. Therefore, this paper focuses on the innovative design and development of a high efficiency digital virtue experimental platform (DVEP) for performance analysis on system validation. Firstly, the parts or the subsystems can be assembled automatically. And then, all types of boundary conditions and connection elements, as well as load conditions are defined and included as the options in the build-up system. Lastly, all the kinds of simulating jobs can be defined serially. The DVEP can carry the simulating jobs even at the off time and generate the analytical reports marked with the corresponding computing conditions. Through the practice it can be seen that the DVEP had improved the products developing circle effectively. © 2011 Intl Journal of Adv Mechatr.

AB The automotive industries lack of solutions for accurately, comprehensively and efficiently fault localization. However, such services in the after-sales networks are crucial to the brand value of automotive manufacturer and for client satisfaction. In this paper, a new approach for the off-board diagnosis is presented, with significant improvements compared to the current technologies usually based on inference rules. A more robust approach that allows, per the additions of functional modules, to enhance traditional computer aided diagnostic systems towards a global diagnostic engine reasoning on different sources of knowledge with their uncertainties. Once the design of a new vehicle has begun, information like the dependencies between the components could be re-used for the models dedicated to the diagnosis task. Moreover, the economic pressure leads to a high degree of innovation with a massive use of electronics in safety, comfort and entertainment (OCCM Software GmbH, 2010). This dramatically increases the amount of data to manage for the testing of E.C.U. (Electronic Control Unit) functionalities. The complexity of the subsystems leads to breakdowns that need qualitative symptom description for the fault localization. Finally, a feedback engine automatically completes the expensive models for the diagnosis and returns critical dysfunctions to the design department. In this paper, we present our research on a new diagnosis strategy for complex mechatronics systems. It encompasses the needs and requirements of automotive manufacturer. The results are presented with data obtained from low, middle and luxury class vehicles. They demonstrate the performance in real field conditions of our approach. They are based on the interpretation of observations, the fault localization and isolation, the evaluation of feedbacks for model auto-completion. The novelty in this approach is based on the reasoning of different sources of knowledge (construction and design knowledge, expert knowledge, return of experiences) which leads to an efficient diagnosis. The approach approximates the optimal path from the observations toward the fault isolation with the help of a meta-heuristic engine. These experiences show the potential of our proposed approach for the automotive off-board diagnosis task. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within the last years, mechatronics as a discipline has shaped the development of complex technical systems. Mechatronics consists of the close interaction of mechanics, electronics, control engineering and software engineering in order to achieve a better system behaviour. Due to the advances in deployment of information and communication technologies, the functionality of mechatronic systems will go far beyond the known standards with the intention to increase their robustness, flexibility and reliability. The paradigm that expresses this development is called self-optimization. Self-optimizing systems react autonomously to changing environmental conditions and optimize their behaviour during operation. The design of such systems is an interdisciplinary task. Engineers in the different fields of mechatronics have to work closely with experts from mathematical optimization and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, self-optimizing systems adopt information processing functions, which are known as cognitive functions. Even though more theories of the modelling of cognitive behaviour in technical systems are being developed and published, an applicable support of the system engineers is missing. Already the identification of self-optimization and appropriate cognitive functions area challenge. This contribution presents an approach to design cognitive functions in self-optimizing systems and its example application to a hybrid energy storage system as a subsystem of an innovative railway vehicle. © Authors 2011.

AB Printing technologies allow the production of fine pitch electronic applications supporting further miniaturization of mechatronic systems. Aerosol Jet® is an innovative non-contact and maskless printing process for fine structures below 50 m with the possibility to process a wide variety of inks, including nanoparticle inks on different substrate materials. The large viscosity range of processible inks (0.7-2,500 cP), a flexible stand-off between substrate and nozzle (1 to 5 mm) as well as the tightly focused aerosol stream for a variable line width leads to advantages compared to other printing methods like ink-jet. The concern of this research work is to qualify the Aerosol Jet technique to manufacture prototypes for MID (Molded Interconnect Devices). Therefore, three different inks are examined for their suitability concerning adhesiveness, conductivity and wetting characteristics on four different substrates. The research activities focus on stereolithography materials (resins) with high heat resistance suitable for soldering processes. The materials are analyzed with reference to thermoplastic substrates. The experiments are performed on untreated and plasma activated substrates. Besides the ink/substrate combination, optimizing the process parameters (aerosol stream, process velocity, and number of printed layers) have shown crucial effect. © 2011 IEEE.

AB Increased productivity, higher velocities and acceleration for feed and cutting motions are requirements for innovative machine tools. At the same time the production process must achieve reduced form and position deviations of the work-piece. Therefore knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of machine tools during the design process is essential to develop high-performance machines. Using finite element analysis and mechatronic simulation, taking the mechanical, electrical and control systems into account, is the first step for optimisation. Developing the control parameters using these simulation techniques is one of the major steps in detecting the mechatronic characteristics. This paper presents a method for developing the control parameters concerning tool to work-piece deviations of mechatronic simulation models including disturbance variables. As an example a 2-axis CNC test stand for feed drive axes will be visualised with its simulation and measurement results in the time and the frequency domain. © 2011 German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).

AB Multidisciplinary collaborative simulation (MCS) is an important area of research in the domain of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). Although previous research for MCS has to some extent addressed some issues like using of multiple tools, integration stability, control of step size, data synchronization, etc, further work is still necessary to study how to achieve improved precision. A theoretical model is formulated to describe and analyze the integration process of MCS. A basic algorithm with equal major steps is proposed based on the model, along with two methods of implementation for the model, namely the serial method and the parallel method. A further algorithm based on convergent integration step is proposed, which has a more flexible strategy for run-time integration. The influence of interpolation techniques on simulation performance is studied as well. Simulations of the performance of various algorithms with different interpolation techniques are performed for both a simple numerical example and a complex mechatronic product. The novel algorithm based on convergent integration step, when used with a high-order interpolation technique, has better performance in terms of precision and efficiency. The innovation of this paper is mainly on the validation of high precision of the proposed convergent integration step algorithm. Copyright © 2011 Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

AB This paper reviews the current developments of high-tech robotic and mechatronic systems in horticulture and future perspectives. Driving forces for mechanization are identified. Dutch greenhouse crop production is used as an example. In greenhouse horticulture the production steps and control that needs to be done in the growing area of high value crops and flowers are still often done manually. Growers are investing a lot of labour in processes like crop sensing, crop maintenance and harvesting the products. To harvest these high value products, a lot of human intelligence is required, such as precise, effective and efficient eye-hand coordination in a complex environment, decisions concerning quality and ripeness and careful handling and buffering of variably shaped vulnerable products. Within the next years the first generation of machines will be introduced in greenhouse horticulture using principles of mechatronics and robotics, combining smart mechanical design with sensors and 'artificial intelligence' needed for these difficult tasks. Examples are the current commercial robot developments for cutting roses, harvesting strawberries and cucumber. But jumping from fully manual production to fully robotised production is a complex challenge and probably not always and not yet the way to go. As an intermediate step, also technology is needed to support current human labour for instance to harvest more precise, targeting on specific quality as a post-harvest feedback and to buffer the high value products carefully and automatically and it is even possible to support human labour by pointing out the ripe products that need to be harvested. Ambient intelligence is more and more becoming a part of the working environment. Here the idea is presented that new ICT developments in gaming can stimulate labour in greenhouse horticulture to do the work better and faster with a lot more fun when there is the challenge to reach new skills, features and levels supported in a gaming environment. Finally, progress in the field of greenhouse robotic and mechatronic systems does not only rely on innovations in the field of robot and mechatronic systems but also on necessary innovations in the field of growing systems and plant breeding to reduce variability and thus to simplify the task for men and machinery.

AB This paper is dedicated to self-handcraft an inexpensive, however, anthropomorphic robot face on the viewpoint of ryodoraku craftsmanship instead of the traditionally engineering viewpoint. Generally speaking, artificial emotions can be categorized into three stages. i.e., the preliminary abstraction, secondary expressionism, and advanced anthropomorphism. In this paper, biomimetic material is fabricated and mixed with the hypodermic mechanisms. Dynamic analysis and computer simulation of the inventive mechanisms are proposed to simplify the mechatronic design of each artificial module on the self-fabricated robot head. Thus, delicate variations of the facial emotions can dramatically spiritualize the humanoid robot with passionate scenarios. Finally, the ryodoraku simulations with PTZ(pen-tilt-zoom) dynamics are carefully examined and successfully demonstrated the advantages of the proposed innovation. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

AB Currently, constraint-free realistic context training is nonexistent in infant physiotherapy. In order to enhance the vocational learning of novices, in close collaboration with expert physiotherapists, we designed an innovative simulator dedicated to the training of infant respiratory physiotherapy. This paper describes the simulator's functionalities and the method used to design its physical structure and the learning paradigm. Firstly, regarding a cognitive approach, relevant vocational and didactic criteria were defined in order to characterize the gesture and determine its limits for a nondangerous practice. Subsequently, we chose physical parameters to assess the criteria and define the specifications of the simulator. The mechatronic functions arose from a didactic transposition of the expected simulation-based functionalities. A 6-month-old infant torso physical structure has been designed with the use of finite element simulations. Its mechanical behaviour provides the possibility to deform the mannequin like a real infant during physiotherapy manoeuvres. A prototype has been realized and validated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Electrical mobility is a highly innovative field with fast development cycles and rapid evolution of its core architectures. Also, the system complexity is quickly increasing. Especially challenging in industrial settings is the tight integration of mechanical, electrical and software domains within so called mechatronic systems. In modern engineering processes, simulation models are used for the analysis of different aspects of such systems. In this paper, we report our experience with a model-based and simulation-focused methodology for system engineering which allows quick validation of different architectural decisions at early development phases. We present an approach for integration between engineering tools using the automated generation of simulation models from the system description. The feasibility of the proposed methods is demonstrated with a sample application from electrical mobility, which also exemplifies the challenges of the integrated analysis of mechatronic systems. Specialized modeling languages based on the UML standard are used for the overall description of the system, for the analysis of its functionality, and for the specification of combined configurations. Another standard, Modelica language, is used for the simulation of different physical aspects of the system. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper describes a modular curriculum development project created by Purdue University Calumet (PUC) in the Mechatronics Engineering Technology field. In partnership with Ivy Tech Community College (ITCC) and College of DuPage (COD), PUC is developing thirty instructional modules in the Mechatronics area. In response to industry demand for multifunctional engineering technicians, Purdue University Calumet has developed an innovative Mechatronics Engineering Technology baccalaureate program that combines mechanical, electrical, electronic, and computer engineering technology skills. This paper gives details about the three-year effort on curriculum development and implementation project. The goal of the project is to develop and integrate curriculum and instructional materials based on an interdisciplinary, project-centered, collaborative learning approach to instruction and restructuring an engineering technology program. The module development is based on the revision of existing courses to serve the changing needs of educational and industrial partners as well as other constituents. This paper describes the mapping of the modules to existing courses in the associate degree plans of study in partnership institutions, which allow students who complete the modules to receive course credits toward associate-level degrees in the participating institutions at the same time. Modular offerings will allow certification at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels in Mechatronics that meets industry workforce needs, while it facilitates receiving an associate degree. This approach enables a seamless transfer for students between colleges and university partners. A complementary aspect of this modular development is also the incorporation of innovative interactive and online delivery of lecture and laboratory materials to accommodate a flexible schedule, integration of experiential learning, and collaboration with industry. Results in regards to these goals, as well as the assessment and continuous improvement efforts of the project and its progress, will also be addressed in this work. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB When a patient have severe heart diseases, Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) implantation may be necessary. However, the improvement of the interaction between the device and the patient's behavior is crucial. Currently, the control of these pumps does not follow changes in patient behavior and the devices are no safe. Therefore, if VAD has no faults tolerance and no dynamic behavior according to the cardiovascular system performance, there is a serious limitation on expected results. This research investigates a mechatronic approach for this class of devices based on advanced techniques for control, instrumentation and automation to define a method for developing a hierarchical supervisory control system to control a VAD dynamically and securely. To apply this method, concepts based on Petri nets and Safety Instrumented Systems are used. This innovation reduces the interventions and unnecessary drugs, enabling a reduction of deposable material and patient hospitalization, and contributes to sustainability concept. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB Offering a large variety of options, assembly injection molding represents an innovative and highly integrative technique of manufacturing mechatronic systems. This is due to the fact that it combines many technical functions such as casings and sealing of several elements made of different materials in one single manufacturing process. Particularly, the combination of various materials is a significant technological benefit and a big challenge at the same time. System tightness is a major target. This paper presents a model to improve the understanding of how leaking occurs and of the mechanisms underlying such as shrinkage and warpage behaviors related to material, process, and design. It shall also be the basis for investigations on the phenomena and development of strategies to improve the systems produced by assembly molding in terms of media tightness. Very important are the complex interaction and intereffects acting on thermal and structural shrinkages, the elements' warpage entailed, and the adhesion between them. © 2010 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB This paper explores the possibilities and the limitations of scaling down DC motors needed for micro mechatronic systems. It is observed that power and torque decrease with the volume of the motor i.e. diameter and length. Hence producing powerful micro-motors with high torque is currently not possible with direct miniaturisation. Alternative ways of improving the performance are crucial. Background discussion is suggested in this paper. Yet, rotational speed increases when the motors become smaller. They can reach very high speed ranges (in the order of 100,000 rpm) due to the reduction in inertia and friction but with lower torques though. A general behaviour trend between the motor size and its characteristics are discussed. It is expected in order to reach the full potential of micro motors that innovative principles should be considered to generate rotational motion suitable for miniaturisation.

AB This paper is dedicated to self-handcraft an inexpensive, however, anthropomorphic head skull on the viewpoint of ryodoraku craftsmanship instead of the traditionally engineering viewpoint. Generally speaking, Artificial emotions can be categorized into three stages. i.e., the preliminary abstraction, secondary expressionism, and advanced anthropomorphism. The formers developed head mechanisms using the RC-servomotor and single-chip controllers on the viewpoint of engineering. However, it is noticed that these approaches are inevitably neglected delicate emotional features, which may result in dynamically obscure and lacking of the passionate scenario. In fact, delicate variations of the facial emotions can dramatically spiritualize the humanoid robot with passionate scenarios. Modulized analysis of the facial mechanism is also proposed to simplify the mechatronic design of each artificial module on the robot head. Finally, the ryodoraku simulations with PTZ(pen-tilt-zoom) dynamics are carefully examined and successfully demonstrated the advantages of the proposed innovation. ©2010 IEEE.

AB The paper addresses a robotic cutting device conceived, designed, studied and built for cutting composite material structures of various size and form in a contaminated environment. The proposed innovative robotic cutting device is developed as an heavy duty working tool of a robotic system composed of a mobile robot equipped with a robust manipulator which allows clean, safe and accurate performing of structure decommissioning tasks. The paper focuses on this robotic device that exploits the Diamond Wire Cutting Technology (DWCT) developed by TS Tecnospamec S.r.l.,1 specifically on the powering and mechatronic module which directly powers and controls the cutting operation of the machine. Particular emphasis is given to those aspects which can facilitate and increase operational safety when operating in a contaminated environment. Due to the complexity of the system and to the need of high operation reliability, the mechatronic modular approach has been adopted and the control modules have been distributed, part on the machine itself and part on the remote PC-based software which acts as a Control Panel.

From the actual point of view the most promising concepts for future passenger cars are based on the conversion of electrical into mechanical energy. In-wheel motors are an interesting concept towards vehicle electrification that provides also high potentials to improve vehicle dynamics and handling. Nevertheless in-wheel motors increase the unsprung mass worsening vehicle comfort and safety. The paper analyses potentials and limitations of innovative passive concepts as well as of new mechatronic suspension systems in order to assure appropriate levels of vehicle comfort and safety when using in-wheel motors with different torque requirements. To reach the mentioned objective, the weight of synchronous and asynchronous electric motors is computed for different torque requirements. The calculation is done by a computer program designed in the frame of an interdisciplinary research project concerning electrical drives for vehicle applications. Furthermore, an overview of the different magnitudes and parameters proposed in international standards to assess safety and comfort (e.g. ISO 2631-1997 and BS 6841-1987) is presented and possible excitation signals to be used are analyzed. The selection of reasonable evaluation parameters is based on measured data of a vehicle with increased unsprung masses and on simulation models. Afterwards, selected innovative passive systems as well as new mechatronic systems with different complexity levels are compared. The comfort and safety characteristics of a vehicle with conventional power train serve as reference. The comparison is made without considering changes on axle kinematics. The paper aims at getting a relation between the different analyzed systems and the torque requirements of in-wheel motors. This relation can be used to select the suitable suspension system necessary to assure the desired comfort and safety behavior of a certain passenger car while satisfying the required driving performance.

AB Existing proceeding-models for the development of mechatronic systems intend a mostly independent development of single components, like the mechanic structure, the electronics, etc., starting from a combined over-all-model. Following the understanding of adaptronics as an advancement of mechatronics in the LOEWE-Center AdRIA (AdRIA - Adaptronic - Research, Innovation and Application), a clear division of the development is not advisable, because of the high structural integration of adaptronic systems. Because of this, it's necessary to develop the whole system by using a permanent alignment of values between the single components. This high grade of data transfer and the high number of relations between the components lead to a complexity that can only be handled by the use of a Data-Management-system. An approach for a Data-Management-System for the development of adaptronic systems by the Department of Computer Integrated Design, as part of the LOEWE-Center AdRIA, intends to extend the functionality of existing Product-Data- Management-Systems. The idea is to model the over-all system in the Data-Management-System at first, using the partitioning of the system into the five elements of active structures

AB It is a common understanding by manufacturers of precision machines that vibrations are a potentially disastrous threat to precision and throughput. To satisfy the quest for more stable processes and tighter critical dimension control in the microelectronics manufacturing industry, active vibration control becomes increasingly important for high-precision equipment developers. This paper introduced the development of an active vibration isolation system for precision machines. Innovative mechatronic approaches are investigated that can effectively suppress both environmental and payload-generated vibration. In this system, accelerometers are used as the feedback sensor, voice coil motors are used to generate the counter force, and a TI DSP controller is used to couple sensor measurements to actuator forces via specially designed control algorithms in real-time to counteract the vibration disturbances. Experimental results by using the developed AVI prototype showed promising performance on vibration attenuation. It demonstrated a reduction of the settling time from 2s to 0.1s under impulsive disturbances; and a vibration attenuation level of more than 20dB for harmonic disturbances. The technology can be used to suppress vibration for a wide range of precision machines to achieve fast settling time and higher accuracy. © 2010 SPIE.

AB Today, packaging machines must be able to quickly and flexibly react to changing packaging conditions because the markets demand a great variety of variants and at the same time declining lot sizes. A newly developed linear module now offers intelligent decentralized drive technology for the required flexibility to be able to achieve relevant and reliable packaging processes. An innovative control design provides for the precise and dynamic motion of the linear module. At the Total trade fair in Birmingham, UK in May 2010, the Gerhard Schubert company presented the newest generation of its Top Loading packaging machine with a new transport component, the so-called "Transmodule". The Rexroth servo controller IndraDrive Mi has an innovative control design for active oscillation dampening providing for the reliability of the Transmodule operation independent of the weight of the freight. The discussion covers how the Transmodule functions; the compact servo controller; active oscillation dampening; increasing reliability; and summary. Significant contributors to the Transmodule are the mechatronic solutions developed by Bosch Rexroth of torque motor IndraDyn T and decentralized servo controller IndraDrive Mi. Since the start of 2010 the Schubert packaging machine manufacturer provides the new Transmodule for a secure transport of packaging in the Top Loading packaging machines. The greatest advantage of the Transmodules compared with previous solutions is that they can operate independently of one another. The modules consist of a vacuum pump for the reliable transport of packaging, a Schubert VMS steering module, and a decentralized servo controller IndraDrive Mi together with torque motor Rexroth IndraDyn T. Energy and data are transmitted completely without wire.

AB It is estimated that approximately 3 million flights occur in Europe each year with a total fuel consumption of some 30 million tonnes of kerosene. Furthermore, in the face of increasing demand from business users and the general public, air transport is currently experiencing, and is expected to maintain for the foreseeable future, annual growth rates of over 5%. Future aircraft gas turbine engines must therefore provide increasing cycle performance, with increased reliability but at reduced weight in order to minimise both fuel consumption and emissions. Among the various initiatives which seek to achieve these goals, a number of particularly innovative technologies are explored, one of which - the Smart Aero-engine - is the topic of the MAGFLY project. The main objectives of the research project MAG-FLY was the development of a technology for Smart Aero-Engines based on the use of Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). These 'mechatronic' bearings offer considerable potential benefits

AB Mechatronic systems designed to meet new EU directives are studied through interconnections by means of electronic and photonic probes, that is, SEM, TEM, SE or 3D X-ray tomography. The modules assembled by interconnection technologies using leaded or lead-free solders are studied for their robustness by subjecting them to accelerated life thermal tests. The results obtained with JEOL 6060LV SEM and with an optical microscope show that although the slow rate of growth of inter-metallic compounds (IMC) is compliant with the expected reliability goals, IMC growth is nevertheless responsible for the propagation of cracks, in particular when gold is present on the PCB side. Innovative Low Temperature Joining (LTJ) technology applied to nano or micro silver pastes which should reduce IMC effects were tested on mechatronic systems. Results obtained from studies by above mentioned electronic and photonic probes of samples are shown. Pressureless LTJ technology is shown to be unsuitable for robust interconnections. © 2010 Materials Research Society.

AB Chatter vibration in machining operations is a limiting factor in enhancing metal cutting efficiency. This paper presents a novel semi-active intelligent control technique for chatter vibration supersession using tunable magnetorheological (MR) dampers. Structural dynamic characteristics of the machine tool (e.g., real and imaginary parts of the frequency response function) are the main parameters which specify the stability lobes diagram (SLD), i.e., the border between stable and unstable cutting conditions. In the present work, chatter reduction is achieved by altering these factors semi-actively, by means of a MR damper. First, a lumped model for MR damper is presented using modified Bouc-Wen model. Subsequently, integrated simulation software is developed for studying the vibration of a lathe machine equipped with a MR damper. An innovative real-time criterion is presented to recognize the chatter occurrence. A fuzzy controller is designed to calculate the voltage to be sent to MR damper at each instant to prevent chatter occurrence. The obtained results show that the proposed method has been successful in reducing the chatter conditions and improving the stability of turning operation with very low energy consumption. © 2010 IEEE.

AB The engineering discipline mechatronics is one of the main innovation leader in industry nowadays. With the need for an optimal synergetic integration of the involved disciplines, the engineering process of mechatronic systems is faced with an increasing complexity and the interdisciplinary nature of these systems. New methods and techniques have to be developed to deal with these challenges. This document presents an approach of a SysML-based integration framework that shall deal with the complexity and bring the different disciplines together for a better cooperation and collaboration. Therefore, SysML shall be used for the overall interdisciplinary system design and simultaniously act as a link between the heterogenous model data of the discipline specific tools. © 2010 IEEE.

AB Small actuators and high efficiency transmissions are essential components in mechatronic and robotic systems, since their performances affect overall volume, weight and power consumption. An innovative miniaturized, low cost, clutching mechanism for robot applications, based on wedge phenomenon in eccentric non-eccentric cam coupling has been designed, developed and evaluated. It is embedded into a human-size, robot hand prosthesis, allowing it to efficiently produce powerful grasps, but it could be employed in all those applications where strict power and weight-size constraints exist and a self-braking mechanism is required. High efficiency, compared to conventional non-back-drivable mechanisms based on screw lead-screw coupling, is achieved by means of roll cylinders inside the clutch. The system has been integrated with a DC motor and a capstan on which a tendon is wound, and then finally connected to the hand fingers. Detailed kinematics, static and dynamic analysis are presented as well as finite-element-method simulations and experimental measurements showing successful fulfilment of requirements. Maximum efficiency is about 0.95 in a large load range, the critical torque at which the mechanism unlocks is about 1 Nm. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AU ABSTRACT: Machines are omnipresent. They produce, they transport. Machines facilitate work and assist. The increasing penetration of mechanical engineering by information technology enables considerable benefits. This circumstance is expressed by the term mechatronics
   which means the close interaction of mechanics, electronics

The conceivable development of information technology and communication technology will enable mechatronic systems with inherent partial intelligence.

AB A key point for microrobots is represented by the actuation system, which enables them to move and manipulate objects, if required. In the field of mechatronic medical micro-instruments a micromotor could be used for the actuation of endoscopes lenses and in powered laparoscopic tools, for examples micro-grippers or micro-scissors, drug delivery micro-pumps and endoscopic intra-corporeal autonomous capsules. The size range of interest goes from centimetres down to hundreds of microns. Scaling down the overall dimensions of robots, traditional actuators are no longer feasible and it becomes essential to employ innovative systems. In this paper the optimization of an existing wobble micromotor is presented and its implementation as microactuator for biomedical devices has been demonstrated. The Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis has been applied on a variable reluctance wobble motor (Φ 5 mm × 5 mm) in order to evaluate all the electric and magnetic quantities necessary for the optimization of the micromotor geometry and performances and to compute its electromechanical characteristic. Thanks to its small size, the micromotor has been assembled inside swallowable modules, both in single and in twin configuration. Motor's simple structure and low cost opens a very wide market where the actuator could be commercialized, as for example consumer electronics, mechatronic medical micro-instruments, robotics, micromanipulators, dosing systems and mobile robots. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper the virtual reality augmented cycling kit (VRACK) a mechatronic rehabilitation system with an interactive virtual environment is presented. It was designed as a modular system that can convert most bicycles in virtual reality (VR) cycles. Novel hardware components embedded with sensors were implemented on a stationary exercise bicycle to monitor physiological and biomechanical parameters of participants while immersing them in a virtual reality simulation providing the user with visual, auditory and haptic feedback. This modular and adaptable system attaches to commercially-available stationary bicycle systems and interfaces with a personal computer for simulation and data acquisition processes. The bicycle system includes novel handle bars based on hydraulic pressure sensors and innovative pedals that monitor lower extremity kinetics and kinematics. Parameters monitored by these systems are communicated to a practitioner's interface screen and can be amplified before entering its virtual environment. The first prototype of the system was successful in demonstrating that a modular mechatronic kit can monitor and record kinetic, kinematic and physiologic parameters of riders. ©2010 IEEE.

AB Nowadays, machining systems worldwide are on a very high level, regarding mechanics as well as control technology. Therefore, in the case of challenging sub-assemblies like drive and control systems and technological components (e. g. high-frequency spindles and processing heads) the emphasis should be placed on the integration of these components in specialised machine and plant configurations, especially by reducing the interfaces with a new communication system. In the future, technological innovations can be primarily expected from the introduction of highly integrated mechatronic machine modules. The concept of this new powerline communication system is the transmission of data and power for a drive unit over a common power cable. This can be achieved by high-frequency modulation of the data onto the cable. In this paper, the basic conditions for the industrial powerline communication are presented. First an overview is given on the existing communication systems in production technology. As an essential requirement the transfer function of the transmission channel is analysed. Further, the disturbances on the transmission channel are discussed. The final essential requirement is the compliance with the standards regarding elimination of disturbances, conducted as well as radiated. For proof of functionality the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex- (OFDM-) transmission method is applied. This is implemented in two modems which have been set up within a demonstration system. © 2010 German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).

AB Insights based on fundamentals are the key to innovative multidisciplinary problem solving. Mechatronic systems depend on the interactions among mechanical, electrical, magnetic, fluid, thermal and chemical elements, and most likely combinations of these. They are truly multidisciplinary and the designers of mechatronic systems are from diverse backgrounds. It allows the engineer to visualize the flow of heat and the storage of thermal energy, and specify key temperatures by selection of materials and geometries that vary the network thermal resistances (conduction, convection and radiation) and capacitances. The use of analogies is a powerful addition to an engineer's toolbox, for enhanced multidisciplinary engineering system design and better communication and insight among the design team members.

AB This paper discusses the integration of an innovative engineering technology curriculum with Web-based technology in robotics, mechatronics, and E-quality at Drexel University. The School of Technology and Professional Studies in the Goodwin College has offered a co-op-based Applied Engineering Technology (AET) major since 2002. The program comprises three concentrations in Electrical, Mechanical, and Industrial Engineering Technology and provides an integrated educational experience directed toward developing the ability to apply the knowledge gained in college to the solution of practical problems in engineering technology fields. The majority of courses are fully integrated with training and laboratory experience to provide students with a strong foundation of engineering practices and to stimulate students' interests by using a problem solving approach in state-of-theart laboratories. Key efforts in the development process include creation of the Network-based laboratories that can significantly contribute to the development of new courses integrated with the Internet-based technology in robotics, automation, and E-quality. Development of Web-based technology laboratories and capstone courses such as Robotics and Mechatronics, Engineering Quality Methods, Thermodynamics, and Manufacturing Information Management are described in this paper.

AB In Europe, improvement in traffic safety is a major topic since the economic cost of traffic accidents is estimated to be 2% of the gross national product (about 200 billion Euros per year). Research in traffic safety has led to numerous safety systems for avoidance and reduction of collision severity (primary or active safety), reduction of injury risk during an accident (secondary or passive safety) and post-crash treatment (tertiary safety). A recent trend in traffic safety is the introduction of various Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) as primary safety systems acting in normal driving conditions and prior to collision as well as improved interaction of primary and secondary safety systems (Integrated Vehicle Safety). The present paper aims at giving an overview of recent innovations in the field of integrated vehicle safety and ADAS. The focus is on new ideas, methods, products and systems to improve the current situation. The paper is not intended for detailed description of the state of the art and analysis of different safety systems with respect to functionality and effectiveness. Forty-four patents out of several hundreds of relevant documents were reviewed. The patents were selected using search functions of electronic patent databases with the keywords listed below. To reduce their number, the relevancy score of the electronic database was used to decide upon their importance in a first automatic step. The date of publication was limited mainly to the years 2007 to 2009. Non-relevant patents were excluded from the list. The remaining patents are classified and discussed. The present review shows that revolutionary new ideas of safety systems are rare at the moment. Future developments will involve more reliable technologies at lower costs that can be implemented in the complete car fleet to become effective for a statistical relevant reduction of traffic accident consequences. Safe and reliable X-by-wire technologies will enable mechatronic systems with enhanced driver assist functionalities. It will be necessary to provide safety systems with intuitive usability and functionalities that involve the driver in the loop. Combination of safety and comfort functions will be extended in future to allow systems that are beneficial not only in emergency situations. An important issue is the standardisation, security and data privacy in communication technologies as well as solving legal aspects of introduction of advanced mechatronic technologies. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB Image‐guided robotics continues to make advances in assisting brachytherapy procedures and synergistic clinical applications. Each anatomical site, access route image guidance modality has its own unique challenges for both the physician and technology developer. Proper understanding of these is key importance for further advances in the field. The lecture will provide a brief technological history and review the state art. We will examine relevant robotic systems, including available robotic systems for brachytherapy, from the perspectives of clinical features, image guidance modalities, and mechatronic techniques. We will identify their innovative and positive features, as well as limitations, challenges, and liabilities. Based on progresses, successes and sometimes even failures, we will draw conclusions and offer recommendations for future consideration. Learning Objectives

AB The competition on the international markets pushes manufacturers towards shorter design cycles and decreasing manufacturing times and costs for their products. This trend generates a demand for smart, flexible and faster machining systems, easy to set up and configure, which are able to drastically reduce machining time and improve the final accuracy. This paper rises from these considerations evaluating the possible application of multifunction materials in machine tool (MT) design and building. These solutions can provide a fundamental impact on functionality and reliability of a manufacturing system. In particular, use of innovative materials in today's technology continues to grow steadily. Numerous reasons for this growth include light weight, superior insulating abilities, energy absorbing performance, excellent strength/weight ratio and low cost. This paper aims to investigate a possible application of multifunction materials in realisation of structure components for Machine Tools. There are many aspects that affect the machining accuracy and the cutting conditions of a high performance MT. The most important issues are related to the static, dynamic, mechatronic and thermal behavior of the machines. In particular, a strict requirement that a machine tool has to fulfill in order to drastically reduce operating time while improving the final accuracy is the thermal stability. This paper shows a complete study and testing validation on prototypes (plates and beam) based on sandwiches with core made of metal foam (open and closed cells) materials impregnated by a PCM (Phase Material Change) wax. Metal foams represent a class of materials with low density and novel physical, mechanical, thermal, electrical and acoustic proprieties. They offer potential for lightweight structures, for energy absorption and thermal management. PCMs are latent heat storage materials that absorb heat keeping constant the temperature of a machine component in a defined time range. The authors have designed, realized and tested the prototypes developing thermal trials, and then evaluating the comparison between experimental data and simulative analysis (FEM). The trials consisted to process the prototypes at a variation of temperature in order to assess the PCM proprieties to absorb heat and maintain thermal stability in a defined time range. The paper shows also a simulative study on PCM material behavior and their application in MT design supported by experimental trials and data analysis. The significant advantages and perspectives that can be obtained in applying of these MT structures complete the developed study. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

AB This paper presents insights concerning a design methodology for mechatronic products. In general, it follows VDI Guideline 2206 [1] and proposes the use of the well-known V-model at the macro-level and the general problem-solving cycle of systems engineering at the micro level. The V-model is customized for the mechatronic systems under development and can be used to describe the whole system (the product) or the subsystems. The paper delivers a background on mechatronics engineering in its second section and presents two mechatronic development projects in the following ones. The third section is dedicated to the product development of an Industrial Robot while the fourth section is focused on an outdoor robot called MAX 3D. Both projects originate from an innovative driving and steering solution developed in one of the previous projects. In these two sections the robot designs are presented together with occurring design problems and observations made during the mechatronic product development of these robot designs. The description of these problems and observations serves for a further development of the development methodology for mechatronic systems.

AB This paper presents insights into two different mechatronic development processes in automotive industry. Both processes were leading to successful products, meaning that the developed systems are in production at reasonable cost. During both processes a series of prominent problems could be observed; the solution for these problems found in the development processes are sometimes not in line with recommended procedures in literature concerning mechatronic product development. Therefore the problems and the solutions were analyzed in detail by means of retrospection of involved design engineers. The basis for this analysis was a model of mechatronic product development which combines the core elements from multiple sources. During the analysis it became apparent that many publications, which research mechatronic product development, focus on the commonalities between the disciplines. In contrast, this paper is focusing on the differences between the disciplines. The focus on the differences is not intended to indicate that collaboration between the disciplines is not feasible or sensible. Instead, the chances listed in the last part of this paper are meant as measures to overcome the differences and by doing so to achieve a higher, more effective level of collaboration between the disciplines. Obviously, this list of chances is preliminary and is only based on the speculation of two design researchers. The main objective of this paper is to highlight fields of action for academic research in mechatronic product development.

AB The importance of mechatronics is evidenced by the myriad smart products that we take for granted in our daily lives, from the wall climbing robots to advanced flight control systems and multifunctional precision machines. The multidisciplinary mechatronic field offers optimum solutions to a multivariable problem. The technological advances in digital engineering, simulation and modeling, electromechanical motion devices, power electronics, computers and informatics, MEMS, microprocessors and DSPs have brought new challenges to industry and academia. Modeling, simulation, analysis, virtual prototyping and visualization are critical aspects of developing advanced mechatronic products. Competing in a global market requires the adaptation of modern technology to yield flexible, multifunctional products that are better, cheaper and intelligent. This presentation will examine recent advances of mechatronics in smart manufacturing and will examine (a) Development and implementation of original and innovative mechatronic systems. (b) Additional modifications and improvements to conventional designs by using a mechatronics approach. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

AB The 'Focused Section on Anthropomorphism in Mechatronic Systems' of the IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (TMECH) is dedicated to new advances in modeling, design, analysis, control, implementation, and validation of such anthropomorphic mechatronic systems. There is also major interest in using data acquired from such sensors and sensor suites for compensatory neural or muscular electrical stimulation, like for rehabilitation applications. Several papers have also focused on innovative systems design realizations and control strategies for highly articulated multifingered hands in an effort to recreate some of the flexibility of the human hand. Researchers have long speculated that bipeds, and especially humans, have the ability to estimate and keep track of their center of mass (CoM) during dynamic maneuvers. The need for reconfigurability and flexibility has led to the creation of highly articulated electromechanical platforms.

AB New mechatronic systems, called self-optimizing systems, are able to adapt their behavior according to environmental, user and system specific influences. Self-optimizing systems are complex and due to their non-deterministic behavior comprise hidden risks, which cannot be foreseen in the design phase of the system. Therefore, this paper presents modifications of the current condition monitoring policy, to be able to cope with this new kind of systems. Beside avoiding critical situations evoked by self-optimization, the proposed concept uses self-optimization to increase the dependability of the system. In this case, the concept is applied to the active guidance module of an innovative rail-bound vehicle. © 2009 IEEE.

AB Increasing functional requirements and system complexity on the one hand and decreasing time for development as well as cost reduction on the other hand are some of the challenging constraints that car manufacturers face today. Additionally, customers expect high quality products. To meet these challenges, a quantitative reliability estimation method, which can be connected with established methods, is necessary even in early development phases. The present paper illustrates a method for early quantitative reliability prediction of mechatronic systems such as in automotive engineering. The core of this method is to support a reliability-oriented system development starting with the definition of a quantitative reliability target. Besides assisting in selection of the concept most likely to reach this target, the method allows to show and quantify weak spots for systems' reliability. Therefore, existing qualitative and quantitative data is used, for example expert information or warranty data, which is combined and compared to the target. Hence, new and innovative components with no existing data can be handled. After all, criticality analysis and reliability optimization is facilitated. To demonstrate the features of the method, a typical automotive system of a new car power window regulator is illustrated as a mechatronic example.

AB Intelligent car headlamps enable a number of innovative safety and comfort functions of modern vehicles. With their interplay between sensorics and actuating they form complex mechatronic systems that benefit from MEMS technology. The use of a novel 3D Hall based position sensor is discussed. In this application, the attitude of a light projection module, which governs the light distribution on the road surface, is controlled in two directions by a single Hall sensor. Different concepts for this application were investigated. In this paper the findings of a systematic variation of the positioning of sensor and magnet, respectively, are presented.

AB The ongoing trend of miniaturisation in the field of micro mechatronic systems poses new challenges for fabricating highly innovative polymer based packages. Printing technologies such as screen printing, inkjet and pad printing as well as the novel Aerosol Jet® process provide versatile possibilities to meet the requirements of miniaturised systems. These additive technologies can be used for the fabrication of structured functional coatings on polymer packages. Passive devices such as resistors and capacitors as well as multi-layer conductive patterns and sensor elements can be deposited on various substrates. Within this paper the results of the latest print studies at HSG-IMAT and IZFM will be presented. This includes printing of a carbon based resistor material as well as printing of highly conductive silver ink and a polymer based suspension with relatively low conductivity. As printing technologies both aerosol jet printing and screen printing have been applied on FR4 substrates and thermoplastic MID substrates. Furthermore, first environmental testing has been done to investigate environmental effects on the behaviour of the printed resistors.

AB The paper describes the feature of a prototypal system for in situ analysis of groundwater bodies. The system consists of a probe, equipped with sensors and with a water sampling device, and of a control unit, connected though an umbilical. With respect to other available systems of the same kind, the one at issue has innovative features, both in the mechatronic design and in the control and data processing architecture. In particular, thank to modularity, the probe can be assembled in different configurations, according to the user's requirements and to the dimension of the inspection well. The system self-organizes itself according to the chosen configuration and, analysing collected data, it can implement a number of autodiagnosis procedures that improve reliability. In addition, using fuzzy reasoning, the system is able to provide a first rough evaluation of the quality of the monitored groundwater body, so to support and facilitate the operator's activity and decisional task. The system can be operated by means of two different m/m interfaces, a simpler one for routine use and a more powerful one for greater interactivity, also from remote locations via internet. ©2009 IEEE.

AB Aiming at the electromechanical coupling system dynamics optimization of spindle unit of refitted machine tool for solid rocket, the optimization modeling is presented on the basis of system differential equations. The research job in the paper reveals that the global optimization efficiency can be enhanced greatly, when the weight value of the swarm particle algorithm can be changed with special exponential function. So, a kind of new particle swarm algorithm, Exponential inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO), is formed by adopting exponential inertia weight function. Based on above research job, the optimized design parameters of the spindle unit of refitted machine tool for solid rocket are obtained in limit time period, and the engineering problem of dynamic optimization of electromechanical system is solved successfully by the method of EPSO. The results are the innovative achievements in the field of mechatronics, and have broad application prospects in the design of robots, NC machine, and electromechanical equipments. ©2009 IEEE.

AB Ageing is characterized by functional changes that can create gait and balance disturbances, which are the main risk factors of falling. Elderly people at risk of falling can be considered to be suffering from an involuntary motor behaviour that restricts their participation in society. One method to overcome such a situation is to activate a new learning process to train for real life tasks, which represents innovation. The SMILING system is intended to challenge the elderly to solve new motor problems in real time by inducing variable environments that need active response and problem solving. Variable environments induced by perturbations will weaken stiff motor behaviour(s), induce flexibility and thus enable effective training and improve mobility in real life environments. The SMILING solution provides a changeable yet safe environment that needs active response and problem solving by the user. It consists of a wearable non-invasive computer-controlled system that applies chaotic perturbations to the lower extremities during walking through small alterations of the height and slope of weight-bearing surfaces. The complete system consists of 3 modules

AB Higher demands on efficiency, cost and functionality have contributed a great deal towards the advent of Mechatronic systems where mechanics, electronics and computer software integrate together to provide the required functionality. This integration has its effects in the design process as well, and a good design requires careful integration of methods and tools to satisfy the overlapping objectives. The set of requirements a designer needs to satisfy for a good design are in all three domains, hence various design and modelling tools are used by engineers to satisfy these multi-domain requirements. With the advent of systems modelling languages for specifying the complete system in one system model, there is an increased urge to link the system modelling tools to the domain specific tools such as Matlab/Simulink. In this paper we present an attempt to achieve an integrated design environment by building mapping between SysML and Matlab/Simulink models. The complexities that can be solved using SysML and the ones which necessitate a communication between SysML and other tools are discussed. Models of an industrial pattern generator are presented to explain the practical influence of this integration approach. The resulting integrated model is more comprehensive for the designer when investigating various design alternatives. This is important for companies considering they have to consistently embed innovation and sustainability in their products. ©2009 IEEE.

We describe all aspects of the NEURobot, including mechanism, control electronics; communication architecture and programming environment. Modular robot encourages the creativity and imagination of the students, while ensuring that the students put in practice fundamental laws of control they are taught in class. Notable innovations include the design of a new core servo unit module and an integrated programming environment supporting modeling, simulation, 3D visualization and rapid control prototyping.

AB Audio-based tools can enhance the learning experience in introductory modeling and control classes at the undergraduate (sophomore) level in the mechanical engineering curriculum. An example audio-based learning tool that we propose is the "FlexSynth," a sen'o-actuated flexural rocker arm that sways to an electronically generated music. We have built and tested the FlexSynth as part of a project under the MIT advanced graduate subject 2.737 Mechatronics class offered in Fall 2007. The angular range of the rocking motion of the flexural arm in the FlexSynth is mapped to a set of musical notes. While the flexural rocker swayed to the generated 'command' music, its motion is also converted into an equivalent 'response' music. Two speakers are used, one to play the commanded music and the other to play the response music. The performance of control algorithms (such as proportional or proportional-integral control) can be discerned from the command and response music, and compared for better musical quality. The appeal of an electromechanical system, driven by music and controlled to see the 'dancing' flexural rocker, makes the overall system an interesting show-and-tell for young kids or the public at large, getting them excited about science and engineering automation. Advanced control issues such as filtering of flexural damping modes of the rocker can also be addressed with this system implementation. Advanced students in the controls area can study the design tradeoffs between robustness and speed in following the command music. While the usual debugging tools such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, and dynamic signal analyzers allow for hands-on learning about the performance of a control system, an audio-based unit such as the FlexSynth can be a valuable addition to the innovative teaching tool kit.

AB The continuous advance in mechatronics has long attracted researchers toward the development of new highly integrated actuators for automotive applications where reduced space and low weight are common constraints. In this context, Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) offer many peculiar characteristics that make this technology very attractive for the construction of miniature mechatronic actuators. This paper presents the design, the prototype fabrication, and the functional testing of a case study, where an SMA binary actuator is used for automotive tumble flaps. The innovative solid-state actuation system is proposed as an alternative to electromagnetic and pneumatic effectors, traditionally used to drive the tumble shaft of an air intake manifold for internal combustion engines. Original features of the linear actuator involve the mechanical architecture and the control structure. On the mechanical side, two contrasting sets of SMA springs are used to actively generate the net actuating force during both outstroke and instroke. On the control side, a current feedback is exploited for sensorless real-time monitoring of the working temperature of the SMA springs during electrical supply. Major shortcomings of the proposed solution are a low response time and a power consumption higher than pneumatic and electromagnetic counterparts. © 2009 IEEE.

AB A new anthropomorphic robot with a five-finger dexterous hand-named HIT/DLR Hand II-was developed to make hand appearance and structural functions more anthropomorphic. The hand is composed of an independent palm and five identical modular fingers, and each finger has three degrees of freedom (DOF) and four joints. To meet the mechatronic idea, all actuators, drivers, and electronics were integrated in the fingers and the palm. By using a steel coupling mechanism, the distal phalanx transmission ratio was kept exactly 1:1 over the whole movement range. The packing mechanism which was implemented in the fingers and palm not only reduces the size of whole hand but also makes it more anthropomorphic. The finger size is about one third of the former finger in this innovative design. In additional, the newly designed force/torque and position sensors are well integrated with the hand. It was verified by experiments that the dexterous hand not only met design goals, but also exhibits great grasping capacity.

AB The paper introduces the new mechatronic modelling approach with the innovative open source semantic knowledge base. The proposed methodology together with knowledge base support enables to develop the mechatronic systems based on the synergy principle focused on the early stage of the product development process. Existing methodologies do not support enough the early design or are domain specific in its nature. The model based approach for mechatronic and robotic product design offers new possibilities in design, and simulations as well as international cooperation, and model exchange issues. The paper describes theoretical framework and practical implementation of the model based mechatronic design.

AB Robotics and medical field both require superior physical gripping systems. They are achievable by a comprehensive biomechanical analysis of the human grip, concurrently with the innovative design methods and with the mechatronic philosophy of approaching complex systems. The paper presents the authors' parallel studies in the area of human hand- and robotic arm gripping function. Applying mechatronic philosophy during the examination, the design and the optimization stages of a gripping system improves the results of the future biomedical or robotic gripper. One introduces a common algorithm based on the functional level and the organ level that define the nature of the mechatronic system, while the principles of vertical causality and of the secondary functions are used to define the system's structure.

AB Assembly moulding is an innovative and high integrative production technology for mechatronic systems. The possibility to combine different materials for the integration of technical functions is a main benefit but also a great challenge. Thereby the tightness of the systems plays a main role. In this paper the mechanisms which cause leakage like material, process and design dependent shrinkage and warpage are explained and above all the interaction of this undergo a model analysis. The complex coactions of thermal and structural defined shrinkage behaviour of the elements, adhesion between this and dependence of the mechanical properties from temperature, stress and time and the design were analysed and described in model approaches. © Carl Hanser Verlag.

AB The demand for fuel efficient technologies in automotive applications is driven by the ongoing and increased CO2 discussion respective the upcoming tightening of the law as well as by the exhaustion of the worldwide oil ressources. Today, micro-hybrid cars using idle stop, micro-regenerative braking and/or electrification of auxiliary components deliver a cost efficient approach within the 14V E/E energy system. Furthermore, the optimization of the components themselves like turbo-charging of the combustion engine, tyres with a low rolling friction as well as weight reduction and LED lighting has a significant impact on the car efficiency. But the implementations of idle stop plus additional innovations like electrical power steering are able to jeopardize the stability of the vehicle electrical power system by its amount of electrical energy and power consumption. Contrary, these mechatronics and actuators need a reliable power supply especially if they are safety critical. To ensure the stability of the power supply the ratio of energy storage and power ressources has to be balanced within the E/E system. Within this paper the optimization of energy and power ressources is shown using an exemplary application and how this approach could be extrapolated to the whole automobile power system.

AB This paper describes the implementation and assessment of an innovative senior/graduate level mechatronics (robotics) module that integrated structured and unstructured learning experiences, in collaboration with an industry partner. With real-world constraints and expectations, students designed and delivered a product as the final project. In fall 2007, the corporate partner provided state-of-the-art, programmable robotic kits with a user-friendly programming environment. The assigned project was to design a biomedical robot to work in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) to perform tasks such as transporting supplies or delivering paperwork. Students with diverse skills and majors were grouped in ten teams, two to three students each. Student learning activities included designing a robot from a box of FisherTechnik materials, without the aid of instruction manuals; writing program code using the PCS environment; and integrating hardware and software. After four weeks of building, training, and testing, each team's robot was unique. In the final competition, each robot was assigned to a particular room in the ICU to perform a specific task. Overall, the results indicated that the students gained hands-on experience with the state-of-art technology and effectively applied the conceptual course content to a real application. © 2008 IEEE.

AB This paper presents the mechatronic design of an anthropomorphic 16 degree of freedom, 4 degree of mobility prosthetic hand for use by transradial amputees. Underactuated fingers and differential mechanisms have been used in order to fit all the functional components (actuators, sensors and electronics) in the size of a human hand. Moreover innovative non-back-drivable mechanisms have been designed in order to overcome some of the actual drawbacks of the mechanisms commonly used in prosthetic hands. The new hand is provided with a comprehensive sensory system embedded in the structure of the fingers composed of 40 proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. The large employment of sensors, combined with an actuation architecture that allows for grasping and gestures, will permit this hand to be used in clinical experimentation in the near future. ©2008 IEEE.

AB Feedback systems with robust and reliable position sensor systems are becoming increasingly important in complex mechatronic systems, e.g. intelligent headlamps. For this reason, innovative MEMS based magnet sensors, such as 3D Hall sensors in particular, seem predestined for such measuring tasks. In order to achieve a sufficiently precise estimation or evaluation of the suitability of Hall sensors at the concept preparation stage while minimizing effort, suitable system models are to be used to help systematically analyze the wide range of solution variants with computer support. This is explained in more detail in this paper. Copyright © 2008 SAE International.

AB In this paper, we present a software architecture, based on RTAI-Linux, for the real-time simulation of dynamic systems and for the rapid prototyping of digital controllers. Our aim is to simplify the testing phase of digital controllers by providing the real-time simulation of the plant with the same interface used for the communication between the control applications and real plant. This unified interface, based on the COMEDI library, allows to switch the controller from the simulated to the real plant without any modification of the control software. Moreover, a set of tools for helping the users in the development of the real-time simulation tasks of the plants have been developed. A great attention has been posed in the automatic generation of symbolic kinematic and dynamic models of robotic manipulators from a description of the robot in terms of kinematic parameters and inertia/center of mass of each link. The system, besides being useful for rapid prototyping of mechatronic control systems, may be used for fault detection, and also as a teaching tool in Mechatronic/Digital Control Courses. A case study, the real-time simulation and control of the PUMA 560 manipulator, is presented and discussed. Copyright © 2007 International Federation of Automatic Control All Rights Reserved.

AB Over the past decade, the internet has become more and more popular in human society which brings significant convenient to researchers and engineers in the joint development of highly complicated products such as robotic/mechatronic systems. Simultaneously, more and more opportunities are being given to students to attend robot competitions in universities. However, it is still very difficult for the students to collaborate with each other via the internet although the communication has become so advanced. This paper introduced an internet based crossover robot remote control competition project. We established a general platform for students to jointly develop robotic/mechatronic systems and hold competitions with the counterparts at oversea universities. The hardware and software of the systems are developed at two universities respectively during which the students of both universities negotiate with each other via the internet to exchange the design idea, unify the hardware/software interface, etc. The competition is implemented between the two systems whose hardware and software are crossdeveloped at the two universities. The demonstration of the preliminary competition between UEC and KMITL proves this project has unique benefits to students, such as the training of the internet based robot control technologies, the communication skills for collaboration with foreign member, and so on. © 2008 IEEE.

AB Direct detection and spectral characterization of Extrasolar Planets is one of the most exciting but also one of the most challenging areas in modern astronomy.For the second-generation instrumentation on the VLT, ESO has supported the study and the design of instrument, called SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research). SPHERE includes a powerful extreme adaptive optics system, various coronagraphs, an infrared differential imaging camera (IRDIS), an infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) and a visible differential polarimeter (ZIMPOL).IFS is a very low resolution spectrograph (R~50) which works in the near IR (0.95-1.7 microns), an ideal wavelength range for the ground based detection of planetary features. The IFS requirements have been met via an innovative integrated design merging passive stiffness and active control to obtain a light, accessible and functional assembly. This paper gives a description of its cryogenic and mechatronic integrated design.

AB Following the considerable success of the 6-speed S tronic in the A3 and TT models, Audi is launching the new 7-speed S tronic in midsize and luxury models in 2008. This will be the first time that a dual-clutch transmission has been combined with the company's superior quattro® drive. The 7-speed S tronic will thus be continuing the range of completely newly developed, innovative transmissions from Audi. This innovative transmission concept's extremely short shift times, high-rev stability, individually adaptable wide gear ratios and high performance combine efficiency and spottiness in an outstanding manner, thus making a considerable contribution to the brand essence of "Vorsprung durch Technik". The paper describes the design of the transmission and deals specifically with the component dual clutch, gearset, mechatronics and oil supply. The advantages of the solutions realised in the transmission are illustrated. In addition, the hydraulics concept - a completely new development - and other innovative detail solutions specially designed for the demands of the luxury car class are presented. The paper concludes with a list of the transmission's performance data and a feedback from the first introduction during the 2008 International Geneva Motor Show.

AB The use of an electromechanical valve actuator (EMVA) formed by two magnets and two balanced springs is a promising tool to implement innovative engine management strategies. This actuator needs to be properly controlled to reduce impact velocities during engine valve operations, but the use of a position sensor for each valve is not possible for cost reasons. It is therefore essential to find sensorless solutions based on increasingly predictive models of such a mechatronic actuator. To address this task, in this paper, we present an in-depth lumped parameter model of an EMVA based on a hybrid analytical--finite-element method (FEM) approach. The idea is to develop a model of EMVA embedding the well-known predictive behavior of FEM models. All FEM data are then fitted to a smooth curve that renders unknown magnetic quantities in analytical form. In this regard, we select a single-wise function that is able to describe global magnetic quantities as the flux linkage and force both for linear and saturation working regions of the materials. The model intrinsically describes all mutual effects between two magnets. The goodness of the dynamic behavior of the model is finally tested on a series of transient FEM simulations of the actuator in different working conditions. © 2008 IEEE.

AB Considering the goals for future automotive powertrains with regard to fuel economy, emission and driveability, some major trends can be observed. On the one hand, adequate mechatronic components must allow for precision control of combustion and exhaust aftertreatment as well as dynamic behaviour and will be a precondition for technology advances. On the other hand, the respective control strategies must be in place and their parametrization and optimization will actually differentiate the solutions in the market place. In order to manage these trends in the automotive development process, the consistency of tools in simulation and test will be key to develop optimum system solutions and a paradigm shift will be required in two aspects. Firstly, simulation and test need to be interlinked in a way that there is best use of available data for each development step, creating scalable models based on physical and empirical data. Going beyond a theoretical frontloading approach a seamless workflow is recommended on the basis of a consistent toolchain. Illustrated by examples, the potential of virtual testing with physical simulation, simulation aided empirical modelling, and the consistent use of design of experiments (DOE) and design of calculation (DOC) is discussed with respect to the dynamic behaviour of a powertrain system. The second paradigm shift is required for the harmonisation of the mechanical and electronic control development process which will both need to be synchronised. Examples show that certain technologies could only be realized by developing control functions in parallel with the optimization procedures for engine and powertrain. The applied toolchain is thus enabling a robust implementation of a new technology.

AB Mechatronics systems offer a great potential for innovation, but they also entails a significant increase in complexity and interdisciplinarity in the course of the development of products. Companies that are confronted with these challenges tend to search for effective strategies and efficient tools in order to be able to handle this complexity and to provide for a smooth cooperation amongst the various domains. Within the joint project MIKADO, strategies and tools are under development to improve the existing approach to mechatronic product creation in order to reach an interdisciplinary concept of systems engineering. The aim is to establish - by means of the development of tools for the creation of networks for requirements and cross-domain as well as of cross-company information and cooperation models - a coherent and integrated basis for the development of mechanical, electric, and control components as well as software. This also facilitates a more thorough cross-check between the virtual and the real total system at any given point in time, which again yields a significant increase in the predictability of the total system behaviour. © Carl Hanser Verlag.

AB This paper describes a research and development project whose aim is to improve the current collection at the pantograph-catenary contact by means of the implementation of a mechatronic pantograph. Its operation is based on the innovative principle of apparent-mass reduction and uses a logic-controlled interlocked system. This pantograph, named T2006, has been conceived as an open test-bed on which to verify innovative theories and solutions, even lower automation level solutions, aiming to improve the pantograph-catenary interaction in the different operation conditions. Moreover the control system allows to emulate the behaviour of variable damping semi-active components. It is then possible, with a unique test configuration, to verify a semi-active version of the pantograph and to optimise it with respect to the speed and the line characteristics.

AB Dependability is a decisive characteristic of any commercialized product. As a quality feature product dependability is a consequence of numerous activities within the underlying product development process. To assure a decent level of product dependability quality management systems provide a serious number of quality measures supporting many quality related activities. Still, no matter how many of these quality measures are applied, practice shows that especially complex products reveal drawbacks concerning the intended level of dependability. This paper in brief depicts an approach for improving the dependability of mechatronic products by applying fundamental remedies to the underlying product development process derived from specific defect type patterns. The approach thereby relies on an innovative defect classification and pattern recognition scheme for mechatronics. © 2008 IEEE.

The focus of this paper is a process for the interdisciplinary product development of these mechatronical systems. This process was developed and tested on the example of the product development of highly dynamic robot drives. The basis for this product development process is a streamlined (i.e. simplified) V-model, as it is known for managing software and mechatronical projects in official organizations. Advantages and disadvantages of a systematic procedure scheme are discussed and concrete recommendations are derived from the experience during the development of highly dynamic robot drives. The contribution of the paper is the reflection of a case study in the growing field of mechatronic design. The developed drive systems for mobile robots are aimed at a reduction of the complexity of drives for mobile robots. Such robots can be used for numerous tasks.

DE Component-based design;  Continuous-time models;  Discrete-time models;  MATLAB/Simulink;  Model transformation;  Model-based design
AB Model based development aims to facilitate the development of embedded control systems by emphasizing the separation of the design level from the implementation level. Model based design involves the use of multiple models that represent different views of a system, having different semantics of abstract system descriptions. Usually, in mechatronics systems, design proceeds by iterating model construction, model analysis, and model transformation. Constructing a MATLAB/Simulink® model, a plant and controller behavior is simulated using graphical blocks to represent mathematical and logical constructs and process flow, then software code is generated. A Simulink model is a representation of the design or implementation of a physical system that satisfies a set of requirements. A software component-based system aims to organize system architecture and behaviour as a means of computation, communication and constraints, using computational blocks and aggregates for both discrete and continuous behaviour, different interconnection and execution disciplines for event-based and time-based controllers, and so on, to encompass the demands to more functionality, at even lower prices, and with opposite constraints. COMDES (Component-based Design of Software for Distributed Embedded Systems) is such a component-based system framework developed by the software engineering group of Mads Clausen Institute for Product Innovation (MCI), University of Southern Denmark. Once specified, the software model has to be analyzed. One way of doing that is to integrate in wrapper files the model back into Simulink S-functions, and use its extensive simulation features, thus allowing an early exploration of the possible design choices over multiple disciplines. The paper describes a safe translation of a restricted set of MATLAB/Simulink blocks to COMDES software components, both for continuous and discrete behaviour, and the transformation of the software system into the S-functions. The general aim of this work is the improvement of multidisciplinary development of embedded systems with the focus on the relation between control engineering and software engineering.

AB In measurement engineering adaptive material composites provide innovative and effective possibilities as integrated actuators and sensors. New piggyback sensors consisting of two ceramics arranged one on top of the other use the direct and inverse piezoelectric effect. Besides favorable manufacturing costs, this sensor offers high sensitivity. The discussion covers introduction; piezo effects in the piggyback; test and evaluation; and current efforts and outlook. The piggyback sensor developed by the Genesis Adaptive Systeme company has short reaction times and so is suitable as proximity and contact switches such as in flowing traffic. A weight dampening study indicates its potential as proportional measurement receiver such as weight sensor. By simple deductions other areas of use are quickly found. Thus, the piggyback sensor can be used functionally specific in machine construction, in the automobile, and in medical technology as voltage sensor system. The piggyback sensor depends on the properties of the mechanical load structure and therefore is freely configurable.

AB Inertial sensors to measure rates of rotation and accelerations have a tremendous potential for innovation. System-in-Package solutions are one of the success factors for cost reduction yet only when geared to market requirements will they be significant in the long term. Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) made of silicon wafers are used in many mass produced products such as for crash recognition in hard disks or image stabilization of cameras. They contain mostly a special Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) electronic chip. Besides optimum signal management, from a direct connection of MEMS and ASIC within a component to the so-called System in Package (SiP) there can be economic advantages when the integration occurs on the wafer level. In addition to the highest volume suitable wafer-to-wafer approach the Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology (ISIT) wants to advance an alternative chip-to-wafer technology. Thanks to its higher flexibility it is suitable for niche applications or products in the low volume range.

DE design optimization;  fault-tolerant systems;  genetic algorithm;  reliability
AB This paper presents a new approach to the multiobjective design of fault-tolerant systems. The design objectives are fault tolerance and cost. Reducing the cost is of particular importance for fault-tolerant systems because the overhead caused by redundant components is considerable. The new design method consists of a special genetic algorithm that is tailored to the particular issues of fault-tolerant systems. The interface of the present tool ePADuGA (elitist and Pareto-based Approach to Design fault-tolerant systems using a Genetic Algorithm) allows for adaptation to various fields of application. The degree of fault tolerance is measured by the number of tolerated faults rather than traditional reliability metrics, because reliability numbers are mostly unknown during early design phases. The special features of the genetic algorithm comprise a graph-oriented representation of systems (which are the individuals during the evolutionary process), a simple yet expressive fault model, a very efficient procedure for fault-tolerance evaluation, and a Pareto-oriented fitness function. In a genetic algorithm generating thousands of individuals, a very fast evaluation of each individual is mandatory. For this purpose, state-space-oriented evaluation methods have been cut down to an extremely simple function which is still sufficient to assess the fault tolerance of individuals. An innovative aspect is also a multistart technique to find a Pareto solution set, which is independent of any parameters. In this paper, experimental results are presented showing the feasibility of the approach as well as the usefulness of the final fault-tolerant architectures, particularly in the field of mechatronic systems. © 2008, Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

AB Plastics producers are manufacturing a new range of easy-flow polybutylene terepthalate (PBT) grades, comprising of nanoparticles for injection molding of filigree, complex-structured moldings, and other new fields of application. The introduction of organic nanoparticles in the PBT grades, has significantly increased their flowability, while improving their processability considerably. The use of the new type of PBT enables producers, to manufacture standard components, such as simple plugs and housings at lower costs. The cost of producing these components is reduced, due to lower melt viscosity of the PBT grades, which permits a reduction in the processing temperature, the holding pressure time, the cooling time, and cycle time. PBT grades optimized with nanoparticles, also create possibilities of their application in technically demanding and innovative functional parts, such as mechatronic assemblies.

AB Many technical processes and products in the area of mechanical and electrical engineering are showing an increasing integration of mechanics with digital electronics and information processing. This integration is between the components (hardware) and the information-driven functions (software), resulting in integrated systems called mechatronic systems. Their development involves finding an optimal balance between the basic mechanical structure, sensor and actuator implementation, automatic information processing and overall control. Simultaneous design of mechanics and electronics, hardware and software and embedded control functions resulting in an integrated component or system are all of major importance. This technical progress has a very large influence on a multitude of products in the area of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering and changes the design, for example, of conventional electromechanical components, machines, vehicles and precision mechanical devices with increasing intensity. This contribution summarizes ongoing developments for mechatronic systems, shows design approaches and examples of mechatronic products and considers various embedded control functions and system's integrity. One field of ongoing developments, automotive mechatronics, where especially large influences can be seen, is described in more detail by discussing mechatronic suspensions, mechatronic brakes, active steering and roll stabilization systems. © 2007.

AB Mechatronics engineering science describes the interdisciplinary synergy of education, knowledge, thinking, way of work, practices, and professional skills. It is supported by strong engineering science foundation beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries and featured by open-ending learning chains with ability to fuse new knowledge and experiences through lifelong learning. Mechatronics focuses on the process of learning coupled with thinking and linked with actions rather than teaching, and fused with concurrent design synergy from the earliest conceptual stages of the design and development process. Efficient structure of a Mechatronics Engineering Degree Programme should provide in-depth interdisciplinary knowledge and emphasise on individual- and team-based learning through problem- and project-based curriculum to fulfil the challenges of modern technology and the demand for innovation. © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB In the face of the global warming, discussions on zero emissions on our roads are targeting the reduction of fuel consumption because it correlates with CO2 emissions, the main contribution to the greenhouse effect. In this case primarily HEVs will be seen as potential force bridging these requirements. After the successful market introduction of some very specific applications, a broad market penetration is the next step. Target is to find concepts which are on one hand competitive for smaller production volumes and on the other hand flexible enough to fit to a platform concept with a high total volume, split into alternative versions with different geometries and functionalities. It is obvious that there is a need for different power ratings because of the great variety of cars and their grade of electrification. If one assumes that there would be for every car manufacturer and car model individual power electronics, it is obvious that this would lead to high cost. Additionally temperature and lifetime requirements are increasing. As the market will not accept premium prices, there is a substantial challenge for designers to provide technologically innovative and cost-efficient solutions. This implies the need for a modular power electronic approach for harsh environment which can be manufactured at a reasonable low price. Inside the InGA project (public funded by the BMWI) the main aim is to reduce system costs by integrating the electronic at the electrical machine for generating hybrid drivetrain units. This means to develop generic technology and modular systems ? built up from components that can be manufactured essentially with similar configurations, but with different qualities, to meet the specific performance, lifetime and cost requirements of the different applications. To master all the challenges, a consortium was built with

Vision systems are amongst the most complex sensor systems both in nature and in engineering and thus provide an excellent arena for testing design methods. A review of current design methods for mechatronic systems shows that there are no methods that support or require a complete description of the product system. The DeCoDe method is a step towards overcoming this deficiencty. The minirobot robot design is carried from the generic vision system level down to first refinement for a minirobot vision system for visual navigation. © 2007 IEEE.

AB The design of mechatronic products has found rising attention in recent years ([1]-[7]). One well-known problem when designing a mechatronic product is the choice of the appropriate systematic methodology that can effectively help in guiding and organising the design process. In the German VDI guideline 2206 [8] a systematic procedure for the design of mechatronic products is proposed. This procedure is to a large extent based on the V-model for the development of electronic systems (compare e.g. Möhringer [9]). This paper describes an application of this procedure for the development of mechatronic products one the one hand in a small design process of a single designer and on the other hand in a large-scale automotive product development process. The small design process consists of the systematic development of a piezo-electric brake. This brake consists of mechanical, electrical, and electronic subsystems and thus represents a mechatronic system. The large design process is focused on the development of control systems for car engines. During both developments it became clear that the procedure described in the V-model and in the VDI 2206 needs to be accompanied by more concrete design methods. Therefore one of the most acknowledged design methodology, the "Konstruktionslehre" by Pahl & Beitz [10] was used in addition. This paper describes the experiences in the application of the V-model and presents first steps towards an innovated methodology, which could systematically organise the design process of a mechatronic product.

AB Knowledge management represents an opportunity to stimulate systematic design. This paper offers a method to develop a design-knowledge management tool for microsystem engineering inspired by bionic software and based upon industrial practice. On the assumption that in opposition to the role of computers in the information society, the knowledge society will emphasise the central position of people within product development, the authors took a broader definition of knowledge than the notion coined by artificial intelligence and embraced a knowledge-based orientation towards product innovation. Then, with the premise of turning artificial intelligence into intelligence augmentation, established knowledge-representations were analysed to determine which one can best handle and depict complex interdisciplinary heterogeneous knowledge entities and their interrelations while supporting the transformations of the concept-knowledge theory of design, as it is required in microsystems engineering. A scenario of the application is provided. The depicted solution can be extended to the development of other integrated engineering systems, for instance, mechatronic systems and micro electromechanical systems.

AB On this communication the work carried out in order to develop a new electrical powered wheelchair concept is described. The main objective is to develop a complete electric powered indoor-outdoor wheelchair, open and modular. Important innovations come from the mechatronic point of view and new technologies related to Ambient Intelligence. An special effort has been done to develop an indoor-outdoor wheelchair, solving the contrary characteristics that are for indoor use the small size (width-length) required to pass through doors, elevators, turn in reduced spaces and for the outdoor use the good stability, certain obstacles climbing capacity (kerbs mainly).This wheelchair includes a special system that allows the vertical movement of the seat from the driving position to higher positions, providing the user to have conversations at different heights, access to objects that placed higher than accessible from the driving position, access to counters,.. Besides this, the user can go down from the driving position to use standard tables, to eat or work at a more ergonomic posture, to take objects from the floor. The combination of this movements, gives the opportunity to make lateral transfers at different heights, reducing the risk and the physical effort of the user and/or the assistant. Security and safety issues have been carefully addressed in the design of the wheelchair. A security centred methodological approach is used to analyse risk situations. Adequate measures are also defined in order to optimise the design of the wheelchair. Apart from that, the wheelchair includes some safety related functionalities such as user fall detection, GPS localization and automatic emergency calls (to emergency services or relatives).In addition, a kerb assistive system and a collision avoidance system are also integrated to improve wheelchair manoeuvrability and navigational aspects. Finally, according to usability and comfort criteria, a voice control system is integrated in order to control secondary functions such as sitting position control, domotic control, etc. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.

AB Our objective is to retain competitiveness in the context of the retirement of the baby boomers who spurred the technological aptitude of Japanese industry. Toshiba Corporation has developed DFACE for Knowledge Management (DFACE-KM), which extends Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) as a process design tool of knowledge management. We have applied DFACE-KM to process innovation of design development and begun a project designed to transfer experts' knowledge in practice to the next generation, focusing on the original technical standards. A feature of this project is construction of a framework allowing young engineers to internalize knowledge in practice by embedding it in a CAD platform and handing on in a community of practice. It is important to select knowledge to be embedded in the CAD platform in accordance with logicality, invariance and versatility. Therefore, we have endeavored to research the knowledge-based behavior of engineers from the perspectives of work breakdown structure (WBS) and engineering standard architecture for product lifecycle management (PLM). In this paper, we propose our paradigm for the design of the knowledge succession process and report on the proceedings and results of a project in a mechatronics engineering department of Toshiba Corporation. © 2007 PICMET.

AB The following project describes the precise assembly of 60 different fine mechanical parts in an extremely close tolerance situation. The whole assembly consists of 80 different parts which all must be handled. This and the fact that the plant must be able to produce lot size 1 is an absolute new challenge for the mechanical and control technical development. The projected plant will be one of the most flexible assembly process Europe-wide! In the PROFACTOR Research and Solutions GmbH business field Mechatronic Automation Systems a unique, high innovative fully automated plant will be developed. This fully automatic assembly machine represents a giant leap in the assembly of cylinder locks. The handling of small, sensitive parts requires grippers and sensors which are able to pre-center them in a very sensitive and exact manner. At Pick&Place and at joining of such small parts there plays the smallest deviation an important role and so there must be found a new, unique and flexible solution to deal with such problems. The following sides mainly describe the development of flexible gripper systems and the sensors for the assembly process. ©2007 IEEE.

The aim of this contribution is to be able to detect then distinguish the undesirable backlash from the useful one inside an electromechanical test bench. The dynamic model of the real system is derived, using the bond graph approach, motivated by the multi-energy domain of such mechatronic system. The innovation interest of the use of the bond graph tool, resides in the exploitation of one language representation for modelling and monitoring the system with presence of mechanical faults. Fault indicators are deduced from the analytical model and used to detect and isolate undesirable backlash fault, including the physical system. Simulation and experimental tests are done on electromechanical test bench which consists of a DC motor carrying a mechanical load, through a reducer part containing a backlash phenomenon. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The development of technical systems results more and more in mechatronic solutions. They combine the advantages of mechanical engineering, computer science and electronics, especially with regard to the innovative performance of advanced functions. This leads to intelligent and frequently complex systems whose remarkable functionality poses both, potentials and risks for the attributes of dependability. Dependability is the generic term for reliability, safety, availability, and security. A knowledge database supports the conceptual design of mechatronic systems with general concepts for dependability. They are defined as reusable cores of solutions in the field of dependability and are provided in a way similar to design catalogs. The database is used in the conceptual design phase of a development process. The design engineer transfers the general concepts to his specific problem and he could advances the concepts as well. In addition to the knowledge database, the paper sketches an approach of a dependability oriented design methodology, the original definition of general concepts for dependability, and the structuring of them on the basis of a cause-and-effect chain for faults.

AB A typical mechatronic product includes mechanical parts, software techniques, electrical and electronic components. This interdisciplinary character significantly increases the complexity of mechatronic products. Therefore, inefficient communication between the engineers, who come from different domains, becomes one of the main challenges in the development of mechatronic systems. Although, innovations in the field of virtual prototyping can help the engineers to handle a complex system and then accelerate the development processes, the technique itself does not offer a solution to the problem of multidisciplinary communications. In this paper, we present a practical solution of supporting knowledge sharing and communication within a multidisciplinary developing group, whose members need to work cooperatively for doing virtual prototyping of mechatronic systems in VR environment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Geometrical inaccuracies and vibrations of the conveyor systems complicate the use of automation as well. The assembly in motion, meaning a robot system which is synchronized in all degrees of freedom to the moving conveyor belt, is a promising attempt to solve these difficulties. Main advantages of synchronized assembly are the avoidance of buffers and the reduction of the throughput time. The automated assembly in motion is realized by using mechatronic components and innovative feedback algorithms which are currently under development.

AB In the past few years, the demands for more complex system development and the ever-increasing requirement for hardware and software improvements have increased the need for a virtual embedded system where the hardware, microcontroller and software co-exist at the simulation level. This paper discusses the implementation of an approach that allows the full simulation of the embedded system. In the scope of this paper the definition of an embedded system refers to the electro-mechanical plant, the microcontroller, the peripherals and the software. The sensors and actuators are developed with a conservative type simulator such as Saber from Synopsys. The microcontroller and the attached peripherals are developed and modeled with the Comet environment from VaST. The microcontroller simulator is instruction cycle accurate. We are describing an innovative concept that will allow co-simulation between the two simulators. This will not only provide the engineer with a very powerful approach to evaluate a processor and its architecture before device manufacturing but also serve as a means to interact with a validated sensor and plant model. The virtual embedded system will include typical components such as sensor, filtering circuit, electrical termination including pin, die and package impedance and any additional drivers such as FET to control the actuator. The software used is original software that has not been specifically modified for this application. This is important, as normally the software has to be intrusively modified in order to be able to trace software execution. This approach will inherently provide a platform for robust controller development that will allow the designer to perform what-if scenarios for the microcontroller, run actual code and evaluate control system with the actual software and peripherals behavior without needing hardware. This will deliver an efficient platform for very quick system development and evaluation cycle. Copyright © 2006 SAE International.

AB Mechatronics has been an emerging subject in industry with the introduction of a large volume of mechatronics product to the market. In addition, it gives rise to tremendous challenge for education of mechatronic engineering, because mechatronics is an area encompassing multidisciplinary knowledge of mechanical engineering, electrical/electronics engineering, and information technology. This paper explains the efforts of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) to embed the education of mechatronics in its educational program of 'Design and Innovation', and the use of a special type of Unified Modeling Language (UML), statechart, to teach the topic of system integration in the course of 'Design of Mechatronic Systems'.

AB In this research work the authors reflect some aspects of state-of-the-art innovation management and product development processes. Furthermore the paper concentrates on an analysis of the phase of conceptual design with a focus on mechatronic design and on product life cycle engineering. The conceptual design phase is an underlying process of innovation, but some steps are recurring in both stages, so one can also use particular know how from conceptual design for other phases of product development and vice versa. The presented considerations for conceptual design of mechatronic systems are not finished yet, some weak points have to be eliminated in the future. Copyright © 2006 IFAC.

AB Aiming at innovative design of mechatronic system, the mechanism, mode and method of innovative design about mechatronic system are discussed, and the FBU conception is proposed on the basis of D&R theory (Decomposition and Reconstitution theory) for the first time. The matching models of function-configuration based on FBU are established. The uncertainty, morbidity and multi-result are reduced greatly as a result that FBU is put forward during the matching process. In this paper, the function syllogism and system innovative design process and symbol expression of function prototypes are studied specially, and the function rational model and innovative design process model are also established. In order to validate the feasibility of the conceptual innovative design method of mechatronic system, the case about Choose-Machine of Spring is made in the end.

AB The mechatronic system for air pressure control proves that the system design in order to obtain maximum operating performance. The evolution in the "embedded systems" domain related with the apparition of some new sensor types permits the integration of the pressure sensor and the smart pressure regulator, based on a microcontroller solution, in the mechanical ensemble. The execution part in the system is a force electromagnet which transforms the driving current in mechanical force. In an innovative way, protected by patent, this force controls the output pressure. The output pressure is monitored with an integrated in silicon pressure sensor. The measured value of the pressure is compared with the desired value; the pressure error signal is amplified and used to drive the force electromagnet. The mechatronic system is controlled through serial bus, RS232 or RS485 type. The experimental results prove that the operating performance in static and dynamic behaviors. ©2006 IEEE.

AB In advanced mechatronic systems, software was traditionally employed late in the development process for costeffectively realizing the required control functionality. Today however, software has become one of the main drivers for innovation, enabling cost-effective variants and online reconfiguration. During the development of mechatronic systems, different alternative principle solutions are usually systematically evaluated w.r.t. physical and economic requirements and constraints. We refine this step by performing a differentiated analysis factoring in relevant environmental influences. For multiple variants of a product line, the evaluation results can easily be reused by adjusting the weights of individual requirements and the relevance of different environmental situations. Taking synergies during development and production into account, a set of alternatives can then be identified which provides high performance at a low cost for the product line. Based on the refined analysis, we can furthermore identify combinations of alternative solutions that offer a more complete coverage of the required operation conditions or a more cost-effective solution by performing an online software reconfiguration in response to changes in the environment. © 2006 IEEE.

The innovation interest of this contribution is the use of one representation language for modelling and monitoring the system with presence of backlash. Fault indicators are deduced from the analytical model and used in order to detect and isolate possible faults on the physical system including undesirable backlash. Simulation tests are done on an electromechanical test bench which consists of a DC motor carrying a mechanical load and including a backlash phenomenon. © 2006 IEEE.

AB The design of mechatronic systems requires extensive knowledge from various disciplines that has to be mastered, applied, and cross-linked. In the various softwares employed, knowledge is formalised and saved for reuse. Academic education has to teach students how to work with software systems while taking into account the theoretical contents and methods and using examples that have a strong relation to research. The research projects serve as innovation pools where new concepts and innovative ideas are developed and realized. An example taken from the lecture course on simulation technology will illustrate the way the students are imparted knowledge on methods of generating and analyzing the equations describing mechatronic systems and also the manner in which they acquire the ability to perform simulations and assess the results.

AB Service robotics is one of the main priority areas of research in the robotics and automation field. The application of these robots for service tasks (personal assistance, education, social tasks, etc.) has a lot of influence in their design [1], [2]. Several parameters will be crucial like the weight, the kinematics configuration, the layout of masses, etc. These service robots have innovative designs and structures that allow them to move in non structured environments, walking, climbing, etc. One of the main tasks of these robots is to interact and operate with humans. For this reason, their design and development methodology must be different to traditional robots. In this paper we present a new methodology to help the optimization of the process design. This design will allow selecting properly the optimal actuators, materials and the degrees of freedom. This methodology is being developed in a national project between two different areas of this university. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB A goal of the collaborative research centre 614 - "Self-optimizing concepts and structures in mechanical engineering" is to develop methods for online adaptation of mechatronic systems to varying environment and system conditions. Here we present an approach to identify deterministically occurring disturbances in recurring processes. The gathered data are used to react directly to the disturbances at following repetitions of the process in view. As application example we use the active suspension system and the active guidance system of the railcab system, which is an innovative system of autonomously driving railway vehicles. The functionality of the approach is shown, whereas we make use of the knowledge of the current position of the vehicle and the available information processing hardware that is already necessary for the control of the vehicles. Our approach is realized and tested in simulations of the active guidance system and at a testbed for the active suspension system. © 2006 IEEE.

AB A versatile new modeling technology was used to help design an innovative traction control system. Using models written exclusively in the IEEE Standard VHDL-AMS language, simulation-based analysis and verification were performed at both the component/subsystem and at the overall system levels. Key insights were gained about a wide range of design issues, from the critical need to bleed the brake lines, to power converter topology trade-offs, to detecting inherent wheel lock-up modes in the control algorithm. This paper presents modeling and simulation techniques applicable to a wide range of automotive "mechatronic" systems, where coordinated interaction of mechanical, electronic and software components is required to meet performance goals.

AB Specialty jobs in high-wage countries can only be maintained by innovative products in new markets. Particularly products that are near to material and procedure limitations are difficult to launch for competitors and copyists. Important for the success is the ability of companies to bring innovative products in high rapidity to the market (Time to Design, Time to Market) and to deliver quantities as necessary on short notice (Time to Volume). At the same time product, procedure and process complexities have to be mastered, so that the quality of highly integrated, mechatronic products does not suffer from the primacy of time targets (Design to Quality). Consequently, the knowledge gained from the product and productionsystem development has to be integrated into the development of the product resp. into the procedure itself in terms of changes as quickly as possible.

AB The paper describes current developments for the optimization and simplification of drives for mobile robots. Currently mobile robots are used for instance as fully automated lawn mowers or vacuum cleaners. Until today, mobile robots have only achieved a small share of their market potential. One cause for the problems of mobile robots to enter the mass markets is the complexity of the drives and steering mechanisms. In the focus of the paper are principles and technological solutions to reduce the complexity of these drives and steering mechanisms. By means of these principles, mobile robots which are more maneuverable with fewer components can be developed. The key concepts for this success are highly dynamic drives for mobile robots. For the development of the dynamic drive system strategies, methods and tools which help design engineers in the development of complex mechatronic systems were applied. A process for the interdisciplinary product development of complex mechatronic systems is presented which is based on a streamlined (i.e. simplified) V-model.

AB MAS (multi-agent systems) and HMS (holonic manufacturing systems) are enabling the vision of the Plug & Play Factory and paving the way for future autonomous production systems. This paper reviews the state of the art in implementations of agent-based manufacturing systems, and identifies the lack of engineering tools as a technological gap for widespread industrial adoption of the paradigm. The lack of tools limits the implementation of agent-based manufacturing systems within reach of only a handful of domain experts. One of the current challenges for the design and implementation of intelligent agents is the simulation and visualization of the agent societies. This issue is significant as soon as the software agent is embedded into a mechatronic device or machine resulting in a physical intelligent agent with 3D-mechanical restrictions. These mechanical restrictions must be considered in the negotiations between agents in order to coordinate the execution of physical operations. This paper presents an engineering framework that contributes towards overcoming the identified technology gap. The framework consists of a comprehensive set of software tools that facilitate the creation, simulation and visualization of agent societies. The 3D framework is innovative in fully emulating the deployed agents, recreating multi-agent negotiations and societies that coordinate and execute control of assembly operations. The documented research describes the methodology for the 3D representation of individual physical agents, the related identified objects present in the interaction protocols, and the assembly features and clustering algorithms. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The first application aims at developing a system to generate digital shapes by manipulating haptic tools that resemble the physical ones that the modelers use in everyday work. The second is focused on the use of haptic interfaces to evaluate ergonomics of virtual products control boards. We designed and developed the mentioned haptic devices; the first uses two FCS HapticMaster equipped with a innovative strong and stiff 6 DOF device carrying simulated clay modeling tools. The second is an "ad hoc" mechatronic device able to simulate some controls with rotary motions (knobs). The described haptic devices are integrated in more complex virtual reality applications; the paper describes their architecture and the methodologies proposed to simulate material shaping and ergonomic validation. The main aspects of haptic modeling and rendering are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mechatronic is a combination of mechanics and electronics and can be defined as a special view and method of engineering. The main difference compared with the traditional way of mechanical and electronic design is the other way of specification and engineering. Interfaces and specification are focused on different blocks and modules in a functional way, independent of how it is realized. The results are not only new innovative solutions with better usage of the modern control possibilities. Also for the interfacing, installation and support this way of engineering provides many advantages and possibilities for cost reduction. This paper shows the actual solutions for dry vacuum pumps and systems in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry that are available to use these advantages. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB Neuronal function disturbances with a motor or sensory background can be partly compensated with neuroprostheses. With electrical stimuli myogenic areas or neuronal structures can be stimulated. In this, mechatronic structural groups and systems help to improve the quality of life of those affected. The discussion covers introduction; areas of use of neuroprostheses; bidirectional hand prosthesis as example; biological-technical interface; the use of mechatronic construction groups; and summing up. The uses of neuroprostheses are diverse. Some are established, others in clinical tests, and many under development. Pacemakers, bladder stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and cochlea implants have already been in use for many years. Functional electro-stimulation such with paraplegics and patients after a blow, is another important field. Chronic pains and incontinence are increasingly being successfully treated with neuro-modulation with use of implantable electro-stimulators. The retina implant is now clinically tested. Spinal cord stimulators are being tested on animals for the control of movement. Neuroprostheses are an innovative and increasingly significant developing field. In Germany, the share of implants, prostheses, and hearing aids account for about 6% of production in medicine. The average growth rate for implants and prostheses between 1995 and 2002 has been 12.5% with sales doubling since 1995. The operation of the bidirectional hand prosthesis is described.

AB In this paper we present a diagnostic system for the end-quality assessment of vacuum-cleaner motors. The system relies on innovative mechatronic solutions, which combine custom-designed handling of the units under test, vibro-acoustic measurements and electrical measurements as well as advanced signal processing. Processing of the measured signals results in the so-called features, which serve to detect and localize even the tiniest faults, in either the electrical or mechanical parts of the motor. Thus the accurate, reliable and sensitive diagnostic procedure allow for entirely fault-free final products. © 2006 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB The design of advanced mechatronic systems involves the integrated design of the mechanical system, of the actuator assuring the precise movements inside the system and of its control unit. In order to make proper choices early in the design stage, innovative tools are required to model and simulate both the entire physical system and each subsystem which are composing the mechatronic device. The usefulness of simulation techniques will be demonstrated through the design and building-up of a permanent magnet modular surface motor, which can assure very precise planar movement in the framework of any mechatronic system. © 2006 IEEE.

AB Product innovations are today only possible if the mechanical and electrical components are closely integrated. Due to the fact that the IT-support of the interdisciplinary cooperation between the mechanical and electrical departments is inadequately, big human efforts are necessary in order to integrate the data of the two disciplines. This paper shows a solution to integrate the MCAD and ECAD data by introducing new Digital-Mock-Up (DMU) tools which are capable to visualize the exact electrical components geometry as well as the mechanical geometry within one 3D-representation. It is crucial for a successful implementation of such a Mechanic-Electric-DMU-system (ME-DMU) that the functions are based on a common PDM system.

AB A typical mechatronic product includes mechanical parts, software techniques, electrical and electronic components. This interdisciplinary character significantly increases the complexities of mechatronic products. Therefore, inefficient communication between the engineers who come from different domains becomes the main challenge that the designer should face to. However, innovations in the field of virtual prototyping offer potential solutions to this problem. In this paper, we present our solution of sharing knowledge within a multi-disciplinary work group by using the concept of solution elements and virtual reality techniques in our virtual mechatronic prototyping system.

AB Today it is very important for engineering programs to have their traditional program streams vested with clearly identifiable themes for each concentration area within a program, and for each theme to have a clear connection with all of the associated course requirements of an area. Over the past seven years three new courses in Mechatronics have been developed at the University of Detroit Mercy for both ME and EE students, through a collaborative effort between faculty from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments. These are "Introduction to Mechatronics", "Modeling and Simulation of Mechatronics Systems", and "Sensors and Actuators". Using these developments as a springboard, an effort is currently underway to investigate the formulation of a new undergraduate concentration area in Mechatronics as part of the Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. This paper outlines the effort, including the difficulties associated with having to work within the constraints of an existing curricular framework in a small college. © 2005 IEEE.

AB Many technical processes and products in the area of mechanical and electrical engineering are showing an increasing integration of mechanics with digital electronics and information processing. This integration is between the components (hardware) and the information-driven functions (software), resulting in integrated systems called mechatronic systems. Their development involves finding an optimal balance between the basic mechanical structure, sensor and actuator implementation, automatic information processing and overall control. Of major importance are the simultaneous design of mechanics and electronics, hardware and software and embedded control functions resulting in an integrated component or system. This technical progress has a very large influence on a multitude of products in the area of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering and changes the design, for example, of conventional electromechanical components, machines, vehicles and precision mechanical devices with increasing intensity. This contribution summarizes ongoing developments for mechatronic systems, shows design approaches and examples of mechatronic products and considers various embedded control functions and systeḿs integrity. One field of ongoing developments, automotive mechatronics, is described in more detail by discussing mechatronic suspensions, mechatronic brakes, active steering and roll stabilization systems.

AB Many processes and systems manifest an increasing integration of mechanical and electronic components with information processing capacity. The development of such mechatronic systems opens the way to many innovative solutions not possible with mechanics or electronics alone. Mechatronic Systems introduces these developments by considering the dynamic modelling of components together with their interactions. The whole range of elements is presented from actuators, through different kinds of processes, to sensors. Structured tutorial style takes learning from the basics of unified theoretical modelling, through information processing to examples of system development. End-of-chapter exercises provide ready-made homework or self-tests. Offers practical advice for engineering derived from experience with real systems and application-oriented research. Written by one of the World's leading experts in this progressive field, Mechatronic Systems will be of great value to advanced students working in control, electrical and mechanical engineering and in areas where such definitions are being superseded. It will also prove useful to practising engineers wanting an in-depth understanding of how these disciplines and that of information processing are becoming interlinked. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2005.

AB In this paper the innovative ALLADIN platform for whole-body isometric force measurements to be used in neuro-rehabilitation for assessing post-stroke functional recovery is presented. A mechatronic approach was used in the design and development of this platform, which consists of an ergonomic mechanical structure embedding eight force/torque sensors that sample data about the performance of simulated activities of daily living in stroke patients. The overall ALLADIN system also includes a dedicated database, where all measures and other clinical scores are stored, and a PDA-based natural language system interface for the therapist. This paper only focuses on the mechatronic platform of the ALLADIN system. The proposed platform, which is currently being validated in three different clinical centers in Europe, aims at offering a brand new method for decision support in neuro-rehabilitation. It calculates and predicts the functional recovery of stroke patients and makes clinical assessments and quantitative measurements easily exchangeable among clinical stroke rehabilitation units. © 2005 IEEE.

AB in the automotive industry SME suppliers are forced to keep the innovative pace with OEMs, resulting in the key requirement for economic production of small lot-sizes. State of the art technology in manufacturing systems is inadequate to meet this requirement. Current production equipment is either tailored towards a specific product or is flexible, but at the expense of expensive machinery; preventing it from extensive deployment in small and medium enterprises. The innovations proposed in this paper are based on the idea of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems, combining the required features of high throughput and high flexibility but avoiding high investment costs for expensive machinery. in this paper we propose an approach for an engineering support for reconfigurable manufacturing systems - especially for reconfigurable machine-tools based on the holonic paradigm.

AB The growing network of mechatronic components within a vehicle, as well as their interaction creating new systems, request special and higher challenges to future communication systems. Besides the software implementation of these innovative systems, the investigation of new physical layers is of essential interest and of special interest in this article. Meanwhile the use of the electrical power supply grid as a communications medium has reached a considerable level of quality. Due to this success, it appears rewarding to open further areas of application for the new and innovative powerline technology, e.g. automotive powerline communications. This paper investigates the properties of automotive onboard power supply networks for the purpose of an integrated power and data transmission. It is obvious, that the electrical power supply system within an automobile has very few in common with a residential area's supply grid. This means that new and different approaches must be found. This article introduces a brief tutorial about the realization of a vehicular high speed data communication on powerlines. Besides the investigation of existing harnesses, a prospect of required modifications and network components will be presented. © 2005 IEEE.

AB The available literature associated with virtual manufacturing is extensive. Far fewer publications have been sourced for virtual techniques associated with specific manufacturing functions, such as metal punching. A novel punching press work-cell has been developed that incorporates many innovative features, based around continuous production using coiled metal. The punching system within the overall work-cell has such a high productivity that problems associated with material handling, in particular, at the output side of the system became apparent. A collaborative project was initiated between an Australian university and the manufacturing and design organisation to investigate and ameliorate these problems. The existing work-cell prototype was decomposed into functional systems to provide a functional analysis of the overall design and to better understand the synergy between mechanical, power electrical, electronic and computer control. This investigation into synergies resulted in the identification of three alternatives to improve overall work-cell performance

AB Mechatronics - the synergetic integration of different engineering domains such as mechanics, electronics and information technology can create new products and stimulate innovative solutions. The rising complexity of mechatronic systems - coming along with shorter devel opment time and cost pressure - increases as well the risks of development. Facing these facts the design methodology has an important task in mechatronics. Methodical support is necessary in order to control increasing complexity, to identify interactions and to introduce the necessary actions at an early stage. A general design methodology which takes the requirements of mechatronics into account does not exist so far. A classification model for design methodologies in mechatronics is presented. It helps to point out the relevant mechatronic-specific aspects and to differ between domain-specific and cross-domain influences and approaches. The analyse shows different intensity of research

AB The new and innovative VeHiL (Vehicle Hardware in the Loop) test platform for future vehicle tests represents an interface between the vehicle and its surrounding environment, the drive lane. It is applied to test all functions and functionalities of various test devices and aggregates as well as their back-up components in total interaction, within the overall vehicle. That means, this VeHiL platform, can be used to test Drive-by-Wire components and their interaction. The application of this new platform allows the location of these components in their natural environment, which is the vehicle itself. In the foreseeable future especially such software based components will become increasingly important within the framework of preventive-active and reactive-active driver assistance- and safety systems. Owing to an horizontal architecture of the different levels of responsibility in future vehicles, a test procedure, as it is applied until now, is no longer feasible- or at least it is considered by the OEM's not to be economical. Moreover, up to now the respective control devices have only been tested in their prototype phase in which they have not necessarily been linked-up with their surrounding components. However, even at this stage there has been a large share of simulative tests for Hardware in the Loop (engine behaviour, ABS, ESP, electronical vehicle environment etc.). Today, with regard to the development phase, many isolated component tests are carried out in a simulated environment (residual vehicle, environment, etc., i.e. control devices and their respective aggregates, sensors and actuators and so forth). The approach outlined above puts the OEM and the component supplier in a position of testing the functionality of components and their sub-systems, as well as the complete vehicle itself in the production-, the prototype- and also in the early development phase - this way time and costs can be reduced. Moreover, by putting this new and innovative approach into practice, it will be possible to realize a secure and efficient future test run - this will become of increasing importance due to the fact that future systems and their functionalities will be linked up at an ever increasing degree. OEMs will be able to integrate further functionalities into the horizontal drive train. For this purpose we will briefly focus on a new possible vehicle infrastructure. Further on we will take a look at the accompanying process. Before a code generation for the control devices involved in the V-process is tackled, we theoretically know from the software what kind of tests must be carried out at the VeHiL and in the completely produced prototype in order to secure a faultless and proper functionality of the partly highly safety relevant components in the total system of the vehicle. For this purpose a FMEA and a fault tree analysis will be integrated already at an early development stage. That way a kind of matrix can be automatically generated allowing a logical deduction of the tests that are necessary. By using this method it is possible to carry out vehicle tests both at the VeHiL platform and also at the test vehicle within an optimised time frame, test procedures can partly be carried out within optimised processes.

AB Mechatronic Design is, by its integrative approach, different from the traditional product development process, generating an extended demand for special design methods. In this paper a design model ("Mechatronic Pillar Design Model") is presented, which assists the development engineer in the description and visualisation of couplings, interactions and dependencies between the mechatronic partial solutions and functions. All couplings between the different mechatronic domains are described in a superior coupling platform. Such product data models for the description of all relevant product information from the different stages of product life cycle play a crucial role for saving time and costs in the development process of innovative mechatronic products.

AB In order to cope with the global challenges in the area of production technology, manufacturers of machine tools are always required to develop products which feature a higher level of innovation compared to competitors. Key words such as higher speed, precision, dynamic and lightness characterize the trends in the field of production technology and rule the vocabulary of both development and marketing. Facing an environment of permanently growing power densities and precision requirements combined with the conversion of larger energy quantities in shorter periods of time, the impact of the transient thermal behaviour on the accuracy of modern machine tools has reached a significant level. As a consequence, the thermal behaviour has to be analysed just as well as kinematic, static and dynamic aspects. Including those aspects in appropriate models by following a multidisciplinary approach combining CAx-tools from different areas therefore is a vital prerequisite to gain important information to be used in the development process of a new machine tool [1]. In this paper, the integrational use of CAx-Tools for the optimization of a lightweight robot is demonstrated [2]. In addition, a simulation environment to investigate the thermal influence resulting from the movement of the NC-axes of a machine tool is presented. In both cases, the aim of the simulation methodology is to identify and analyse the heat input by using real NC-programs already at an early stage of the design process by means of computer models. Subsequently, the simulation environment is used to calculate the resulting deformations and displacements of the machine components. The results gained from the simulation can provide valuable information to be considered when designing machine tools, such as for the correct location of measurement systems, the sensor technology as well as for the development of compensation strategies. Currently, the simulation methodology is being validated by applying it to a 5-axes universal milling machine. The methodology used hereby is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach and the simulation of mechatronic systems by combining mechatronic, electric, thermal, fluid-mechanical and control engineering components.

AB By means of the innovative X-by-Wire technology new developments have been initiated in the automotive industry. X-by-Wire does not only mean the replacement of mechanical and hydraulic components via mechatronic systems but also the implementation of intelligent driving systems. These new systems are meant to relieve the driver from all routine jobs and to support him/her in all critical driving situations. The aim is to avoid accidents. The two-wheel single track model is used to obtain a mathematical description of the vehicle dynamics. The single track model is extended by the vehicle's roll dynamics, to take into account the influence of the height of the center of gravity. The first part of the feedback control system design is focused on the reduction of external yaw disturbance, based on the robust unilateral decoupling of car steering. Robust decoupling is achieved by an integral feedback of the yaw-rate to the front-wheel steering angle. The second part of the feedback control system design is focused on rollover avoidance by active steering. One way to reduce the rollover risk due to transient driving maneuvers is reached by feedback of the roll-rate to the front-wheel steering angle. The second way to avoid rollover is by introducing an emergency steering feedback control system. The idea of this feedback control system is to limit the steering angle in such a way, that rollover can be avoided, with priority on rollover avoidance over lane keeping, because a tilted vehicle is no longer steer able. The feedback control system presented in the first part of this investigation is implemented into a multi-body-model of a commercial vehicle and concludes with the simulation of a combination of the multi-body model and the feedback control system, with the software package MSC.ADAMS/Car.

DE knitting machine; take-down mechanism
AB KARL MAYER with its latest release for the RJWB and RJPC net curtain machines, is focusing on optimization of the drives. With January 1, 2005, KAMCOS has become a feature of RJWB and RJPC net curtain machines. This latest Command System is responsible for controlling all the machine's sequences, permits communication through the touchscreen operator interface easily. However, when incorporating this Command System into the RJWB and RJPC machine series, it is necessary to integrate the touchscreen interface, and to make some changes in the fabric take-down system and to fabric batching. These two machine functions have been fitted with electronic drives, which results in a number of advantages, such as during fabric take-down, replacing the mechanical drives makes it much easier to change the pattern and run in a new design. Moreover, the use of electronic drives reduces the amount of maintenance work, and enables the speed to be selected steplessly. These mechatronic systems offer excellent reproducibility, thus a reliable and dependable knitting process. With its new developments, KARL MAYER, is introducing new innovations, which will encourage companies to try out the new technical possibilities on offer, and to develop new net curtain patterns for the interior design sector.

AB Karl Mayer, a leading company in warp knitting machines, presented a highly innovative technology for producing a series of Jacquardtronic lace machines, during company open-days held in Obertshausen on September 7-8, 2004. In the show, four machines were displayed at the company's Development Centre, which included Jacquardtronic Lace JL 65/1, JL 95/1, Textronic Lace TL 66/1/36, and Fascination FL 20/16. The company's Technical Centre also exhibited RSJ 5/1, a high-performance jacquard machine for raschel fabrics. The product developers at Karl Mayer converted a furnishing fabric into weatherproof clothing, which possessed comfort-giving properties. The warp knitting machines at Karl Mayer can be built with one or two needle bars, which enables the formation of one or two stitch courses per main shaft revolution. The introduction of a new mechatronic automation computer concept will simplify the handling and maintenance work of the machines. This concept combines the latest computer technology in a network and is based on the principles of standardization, modular design, and upgradation possibilities. The advanced features of the computer concept will be incorporated in the company's warp knitting machine program with effect from January 1, 2005, for their better performance.

AB Medical robotics and computer assisted surgery are feasible and promising applications of robotic technology, whose main goals are surgical augmentation, information enhancement and improved surgical action. Neurosurgery probably presents the most major challenges, and can considerably benefit from the introduction of computers and robots to guide surgical procedures. This paper presents an innovative master-slave haptic robotic system for minimally invasive neurosurgery, which can help surgeons overcome human shortcomings and perform more accurate, repeatable, and reliable stereotactic neurosurgery. The system, named LANS, consists of a slave mechatronic actuator and a haptic master. The slave is designed to move linearly a laser pointer, a biopsy needle or a low-energy X-ray emitter along a pre-planned axis. The tool insertion into the brain is guided by the surgeon through the haptic master which also provides force feedback to the operator. Not only can the haptic master reproduce the contact force between the surgical tool and the treated tissue, but it can also produce virtual forces aimed at assisting surgeons during the operations. Experiments have been conducted to prove the soundness and accuracy of the overall system mechanical design and to assess the effectiveness of the control schemes synthesized for the master and the slave.

AB In the first part of the presentation detailed description of the modular technical system built up of electric components and end-effectors is given. Each of these components was developed at different industrial companies separately. The particular mechatronic unit under consideration was constructed by the use of the appropriate mathematical model of these units. The aim of this presentation is to publish the results achieved by the use of a mathematical modeling technique invented and applied in the development of different mechatronic units as drives and actuators. The unified model describing the whole system was developed with the integration of the models valid to the particular components. In the phase of testing the models a program approximating typical realistic situations in terms of work-loads and physical state of the system during operation was developed and applied. The main innovation here presented consists in integrating the conclusions of professional experiences the developers gained during their former R&D activity in different professional environments. The control system is constructed on the basis of classical methods, therefore the results of the model investigations can immediately be utilized by the developer of the whole complex system, which for instance may be an industrial robot.

AB This paper is concerned with developing innovative solutions for flexure control of robotic and other mechatronic systems with structural flexibility. It focuses on the utilization of smart sensor and actuator technologies for flexure control. In this regard, use of promising modern sensor and actuator technologies such as piezoelectric (PZT) transducers and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators is studied. Implementation of a nonlinear control algorithm is presented for a two-link manipulator actuated by PZT transducers. Furthermore, deflection control of a flexible beam is studied using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators. Experimental results are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the control algorithms and improved performance of the controllers over conventional ones.

AB Karl Mayer's lace machine program has received a significant boost with the introduction of the Textronic® Lace TL 31/1/24 and the Jacquardtronic® Lace JL 36/1. The new machines integrate latest innovation, which include the string bar concept for controlling the pattern yarn guides, with shog paths of up to 170 needles and inline EL drives for control of the ground guide bars. The machines also feature a new computer system, efficient compact control devices and networking possibilities, and a comprehensive mechatronic concept for executing the main machine functions. The JL 36/1 maintains the concept of the staggered arrangement of the 30 pattern guide bars and combines high quality with extremely fast production speeds. On the other hand, TL 31/1/24 model offers a marked increase in performance and efficiency by incorporating the new string bar technology. The new technical features of the lace machines not only give its customer faster speed and better quality, but also more variety.

AB The demand for flexible and individualized passenger and cargo transportation becomes more and more apparent. Considering modern railway-systems this development provokes a modular approach for optimum operation from the top logistics-level down to the low-level of mechatronic components. The resulting vision comprises innovative vehicles - so called shuttles - that behave autonomously within changing environments and requests from passengers. The shuttles require inherent intelligence to fulfill these demands. We propose working-principles of self-optimization as basic building blocks for intelligent self-optimizing transportation systems. An approach for a knowledge model together with a process model of self-optimizing systems shall direct the experience-based behavior of each system element. The prediction of a shuttle's negotiation-strategy when crossing a switch acts as an application case for the forwarded idea of working-principles of self-optimization within modular autonomous shuttle transportation systems.

AB Highly innovative warp knitting machines were presented by KARL MAYER at its company open days, held on 7 and 8 September, 2004, in Obertshausen, Germany. To gather more information on the results of the latest development work carried out by KARL MAYER, well known producers from all over the world attended the presentation. A completely new generation of four machines were on show, namely, the Jacquardtronic® Lace JL 65/1 and JL 95/1, Textronic® Lace TL 66/1/36, and the Fascination FL 20/16. Precise relationships existing between the mechatronic systems were demonstrated, where the guests examined for themselves the accurate interplay between all the individual components, in addition to the high production rate of the models. When presented to the members of the trade press, who were invited to view the works and the machines on 9 September, the new lace machines met with a similar good response and a general consensus was that the new technology machines will revolutionize the industrial production of lace. KARL MAYER has once again won the confidence of its old and new clients and has strengthened its reputation as a world leader on the market.

AB The investment and operating costs of rail vehicles are substantially determined by the selection of their sub-systems. Right from the early planning stage of the vehicle design, preliminary decisions influencing subsequent life cycle costs are already made. Continuing development of proven and tested technologies for the purpose of offering products to the operator, which, on the one hand, are fully developed, and, on the other hand, unify the advantages of modern technologies with low operating costs represents the basic of all innovations. Some examples of recently launched products of KNORR-BREMSE serve for illustration. The new generation of piston compressors work without oil lubrication. Recent developments of electro-pneumatic brake controls offer interesting advantages due to combination of electronics and valve assemblies in a compact mechatronic unit. Furthermore new brake pad technologies are applied in order to guarantee brake force generation since installation spaces in modern vehicles are getting smaller and smaller. Besides, aluminium brake discs can contribute to improve significantly economic profitability.

AB For MSR Robots to successfully configure from one configuration into another, the control system must be able to visualize the current structure of the robot, which cannot be done without appropriate information about each module's docking status. Although the type of information required to visualize the structure of a MSR robot differs with the physical design of the modules, there are essential information that are commonly required, such as docking orientation and identity of neighboring modules. This paper presents a novel multi-port and multi-orientation modular robot, and a representation method that can uniquely represent the geometric structure of a group of connected modules and to analyze the number of "reconfigurable DOF" within the structure. The proposed method uses labeled planar graphs and incidence matrices to describe the docking status of the modules within the structure, which helps to effectively encode the data in computer understandable expressions. In addition to the work in configuration analysis, an innovative mechanism for detecting the orientation of each docking port is also presented.

AB This paper discusses work-in-progress as part of a joint research endeavour of the Technical University Berlin and the University of Leipzig focussing on Surgical Workflow (S-WF) and S-PACS. It is based on the assumption that significant ergonomic and health-economic progress in the operation room (OR) can only be achieved through a thorough understanding of the surgical activities or deeds by all groups involved in CAS research. S-WF modelling and visualization can assist the creative activity of designing surgical integration profiles (SIP) which may subsequently be selected for surgical process redesign. Research with these aims can only be carried out in a research setting where surgeons, radiologists, and computer scientists jointly advance the field of Computer-Assisted Radiology and Surgery (CARS).

AB Remote access laboratories using internet communications have been available in prototype form since the mid 1990's (Goldberg 1994, Taylor and Trevelyan 1995, Henry 1996). However, much more has been written on the technologies behind these innovations than effective ways to make use of them in learning environments. Remote labs complement other course work rather than replacing conventional hands-on lab experiences. This paper describes a sequence of short remote lab exercises integrated with weekly tutorials, each exploring different aspects of the course. The results suggest that most students operated the equipment for much more time, in total, than with conventional lab classes, and spent considerable amounts of time exploring equipment behaviour for themselves rather than following a pre-defined procedure. The paper also reviews the effect on the class of a significant unplanned absence of the lecturer for several weeks in the middle of the course and how the remote labs system enabled the lecturer to monitor student lab work while absent. These results provide useful insights into the effectiveness of remote access internet labs compared with conventional labs. Copyright © IFAC Mechatronic Systems, Sydney, Australia, 2004.

AB This paper presents a flatness-based control under uncertainties for a carriage driven by two pneumatic muscle actuators. First, the modelling of the mechatronic system is addressed. The pneumatic system part is characterised by dominant non-linearities, which have been identified and approximated by polynomial functions. Exploiting differential flatness with carriage position and mean muscle pressure as flat outputs, a trajectory control is designed and implemented. Disturbance behaviour and tracking accuracy concerning remaining model uncertainties are significantly improved by observer-based disturbance compensation. Measurements demonstrate an excellent control performance and emphasize both applicability and potential of tlus innovative actuator. Copyright © 2004 IFAC.

AB Mechatronic solutions are progressively influencing innovative products from the most diverse range of applications. To ensure the optimum integration of mechanical, electronical and software components to form complete systems, modules are increasingly being based on flexible circuit carriers. Despite technological advantages, the use of foil based electronic circuits in main stream manufacturing has not arisen due to the absence of suitable production technologies. This article presents various concepts and prototype solutions to realize an economic process with the main focus on automated reel-to-reel manufacturing. The substrates are rigidly coupled in a panel during the paste application, assembly and reflow process steps and are separated at the end of the complete process sequence. This procedure requires both innovative systems and processes and new concepts for controlling the whole line.

AB The paper focuses on a robotic system conceived, designed, studied and built for cutting the legs of the off-shore platforms a few meters below the seabed. The work has been performed within the research project SBC Diamond Wire Cutting System Sub Bottom Cutter (GRD1 2000 25740) funded by the European Commission under the Fifth Research Programme and recently successfully closed. The proposed robotic system is an innovative prototypal machine able to anchorage on the seabed soil in front of the leg to be cut, to drill the soil at the given depth by limiting the volume of removed materials and to cut the sub-sea structure. Due to the complexity of the system and to the need of high operation reliability, the mechatronic modular approach has been adopted and the control modules have been distributed part on the sub-sea front-end and part on the support vessel remote-ope rated control stand. Simulation dynamic models of the robotic subsystems have been set-up and used for the knowledge base of the control system. Copyright © 2004 IFAC.

AB In this paper, a novel design approach for the development of robot hands is presented. This approach, that can be considered alternative to the "classical" one, takes into consideration compliant structures instead of rigid ones. Compliance effects, which were considered in the past as a "defect" to be mechanically eliminated, can be viceversa regarded as desired features and can be properly controlled in order to achieve desired properties from the robotic device. In particular, this is true for robot hands, where the mechanical complexity of "classical" design solutions has always originated complicated structures, often with low reliability and high costs. In this paper, an alternative solution to the design of dexterous robot hand is illustrated, considering a "mechatronic approach" for the integration of the mechanical structure, the sensory and electronic system, the control and the actuation part. Moreover, the preliminary experimental activity on a first prototype is reported and discussed. The results obtained so far, considering also reliability, costs and development time, are very encouraging, and allows to foresee a wider diffusion of dextrous hands for robotic applications.

AB ITMA 2003 in Birmingham/England and IKME 2003 in Milan/Italy showed very similar trends as far as developments in warp and weft knitting machines were concerned. The flexibility of the machines has been increased by making many improvements in their details, and by the extensive use of mechatronic systems. The machines have become more flexible in terms of their working width, and also by reducing the time needed to changeover the article. Special machine/technical systems now enable particularly fine, as well as coarse knitted fabrics to be produced. It was obvious that the main emphasis was not on increasing the performance, although moderate increases in efficiency were achieved on most of the warp and weft knitting machines, often in combination with reducing the noise levels. The use of mechatronic systems and the greater flexibility have made it necessary to increase the use of electronic machine control systems. New patterning software, machine control systems, and production data recording systems increase efficiency in production preparation, monitoring and control. Machine systems can be networked and connected to the Internet in almost every case, and some were also being shown in conjunction with manufacturer-specific systems.

This is not only true for the infotainment and the powertrain domain but increasingly also for the comfort or body electronics domain. In the recent years body electronics has gone through a very interesting development. The introduction of multiplexed ECUs, the replacement of electrics by power electronics and a tremendous number of new end customer visible functions has put the body network on a high level of complexity. With the introduction of the 42V power net, mechatronic components and hierarchical networking new challenges are seen.

AB An innovative way of lowering engine fuel consumption is to reduce engine displacement. However, smaller engines featuring reduced swept volume typically exhibit insufficient torque at low engine speeds. Conventional exhaust turbochargers are not able to compensate for this behavior and additionally suffer from the familiar turbo lag. One possible solution may be an electrically assisted turbocharger, with a high-speed motor providing the extra boost at low engine speeds. A critical factor for the efficiency of the concept is the ratio of the electric motor torque and the rotational mass inertia of the rotor. Testbench evaluation shows acceleration times of 0.5 seconds to reach speeds up to 70,000 rpm. Typically, the electrical load of such systems goes up to 3 kW. Target motors are various types of electrically commutated motors such as BLDC, switched reluctance or induction motors. This paper describes a system solution for controlling high-dynamic motors like the one used for the electrically assisted exhaust turbocharger (e-turbo). It presents the strengths and the limits of the solution. Copyright © 2003 SAE International.

AB In defining innovative and cost-effective chip sets for future automotive applications, system architects need high-level tools that allow them to rapidly determine the best silicon partitioning for a given application in terms of system performance as well as cost. The tool needs to be flexible, modular, and swift such that the system designer can perform abstract simulation iterations quickly for various functional partitioning scenarios, without requiring excessive computer resources. The tool must also be portable and adaptable to provide a simulation environment suitable to systems- or car-manufacturers for in-depth applications simulation and architecture assessment. The semiconductor component definition process using such a "mission-level" design tool for the automotive application electronic valve will be demonstrated. Methods for the analysis of electronic valve control system architectures using mission-level simulation will be developed. Simulation results and corresponding analysis of electromagnetic valve control performance within two primary types of system architectures, centralized and mechatronic, will be provided. Control algorithms using various sampling frequencies and accuracies for position and current data acquisition are included within simulation. Analysis will determine processing power needed to effectively follow and manage current dynamic and valve position. Timing diagrams of communication will characterize bus traffic in order to evaluate speed of communication busses between power devices and valve microcontroller, as well as between the VCU and ECU. The type of instructions to be processed by the valve control algorithm to deliver the appropriate output to the electromagnetic valve will be determined so that an appropriate microprocessor can be selected. A semiconductor architecture recommendation based upon simulation results and analysis, in addition to cost considerations, will identify a best-fit silicon strategy for the end application.

In order to yield this potential, experts from the involved domains need a mechatronic-specific guideline for the systematic design of mechatronic systems. In industry guidelines are unfortunately not accepted in the intended way; adaptability to the present design situation is missed.

In addition, it offers an example of a highly integrated mechatronic system. A bonded-ferrite inner rotor has been developed with an integrated front centrifugal impeller which is driven by the magnetic interaction of a rotating field created by claw-poles. The two phase unipolar coil arrangement is fed by an internal circuit using two MOSFETS controlled by the commutation signal from a bipolar Hall-IC. This is the first mass-production example of an electrical machine for an automotive application where the claw pole topology is used to realise the armature of the motor (i.e. the rotating field) and not the excitation field.

AU ABSTRACT: In recent years a wide variety of industries and technologies have been intersecting to create new products and solve new problems. Since these new technologies typically occur at the interfaces of science and engineering (producing new fields such as "nanotechnology"), we call this phenomenon "Converging Technologies." In view of the continuing rapid growth of technology
   it appears that the Converging Technologies phenomenon will continue to define the world for the foreseeable future. Union College is implementing a new initiative that brings cutting-edge Converging Technologies into our classrooms in innovative ways. We see special opportunities to integrate topics in bioengineering, nanotechnology
   mechatronics, and pervasive computing into our undergraduate engineering and liberal arts programs. Converging Technologies includes various skills and disciplines across the campus. For example
   combining the skills of a computer scientist with the needs of a graphic artist, or those of an engineer with the needs of a biologist or a chemist or a physicist
   often producing unique results. At Union College we are currently adding Converging Technologies topics to existing engineering and liberal arts courses and developing new undergraduate introductory courses in specific Converging Technologies areas. As a college with historic and well-known programs in both engineering and the liberal arts, we are building on our strengths to produce highly informed citizens for the 21 st century.

AB On the basis of mechatronic solution elements. Modern mechanical engineering is based on the tight interaction of mechanical, electronical and control technology components as well as software. In this context the time to market is to be reduced and the optimization of product characteristics is to be optimized. As a consequence, the need for co-ordination between the different domains' engineers rises significantly. However, the cross-domain engineering is aggravated by creating product data in various CAE software tools and therefore in incompatible formats. Moreover, approved solutions that fulfill a product's function(s) - which we denote as solution elements - are documented only to a rather limited degree. In this article, a new representation of mechatronical solution elements are presented. It focuses on a conception that bring the domain-specific views together. By this means, the development time of innovative products can be reduced significantly, and a high quality of development results can be achieved. This conception is based on a product data management system. It is validated on a new vehicle prototype that has been developed co-operatively, together with teams of the professors Anderl and Lückel in the context of a project funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Machine tools, plastics processing machinery, mechanical and hydraulic presses, tractors, agricultural and construction machinery, to name but a few examples, are unthinkable without electronic and electromechanical components, assemblies, and systems, not to forget the sensors. The term mechatronics, which is derived from the systematic integration of microelectronics and microsystems technology into fluid power and mechanical systems, does not adequately do justice to the entire field of fluid power and mechanical drive systems technology.

AB Piezoelectric ceramic/polymer composites are important smart materials that have found many sensor and mechatronic device applications. In this work, piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic was cut using a high power laser to obtain very fine scale patterns. The advantage of using laser cutting is that new and innovative pattern design can be implemented. To illustrate this, fine concentric circular grooves were cut in a 10 mm diameter PZT disc and then the grooves were filled with epoxy to form a ceramic/polymer 2-2 composite. Also a 1-3 composite consisting of PZT rods imbedded in a polymer matrix was fabricated. The electromechanical properties of these composites were measured and reported. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Mechatronic is a key technology combining different disciplines as mechanics, electronics and software while creating intelligent devices. Integration is therefore a must and Flexible Printed Circuits (FPCs) are an ideal platform to achieve this. As an electronic carrier and connector of mechanical functions they offer unprecedented freedom in design as well as space for innovation. Applications such as wing mirrors, integrated transmission control units and door latches prove advantages due to the wide range of available materials and surface treatments, common assembly and connection options in addition to 3-dimensional and connectorless design. FPC based solutions provide an enormous potential to expand functionality and to decrease costs while reliability increasing.

On the basis of electronic actuation, the overall concept of an integrated powertrain is realized for performing holistic movement assignments, including the driving, braking, steering and carrying functions. Specifying a movement wish (direction and acceleration) at an electronic coordination level causes the powertrain to be activated as a drive-by-wire module. The paper outlines both the possibilities of system architecture design and the degrees of function integration, with the goal of using the smallest possible number of control units.

AB By using mechatronic subassemblies and telediagnosis. The use of diagnosis systems offers a high degree of potential in terms of cost-reduction, flexibility of the manufacturer in reacting to customers' wishes and requirements, and thus also in terms of increasing customer loyalty. However, these innovative technologies have not been adopted by more than just a few companies, the reason being on the one hand the scepticism on the part of many customers as to the possibility of security-related shortcomings in communication networks. On the other hand there are currently no telediagnosis systems with standardized interfaces to enable easy linkage with the plants. The introduction of a 24-hour service constitutes a further decisive competitive advantage on the international market, and being able to do this calls for the establishment of corresponding service bases in various time zones in order to ensure permanent readiness for service.

AB Progress in mobile robotics requires the researchers to access and improve all modules that compose the robot, from low-level mechanical components to high-level reasoning systems. This paper presents the development process of the robots built at the Autonomous Systems Lab, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland. Starting from the mechanical and electrical design up to the application, we show the challenges that needed to be faced as well as the solutions that have been devised. The description covers aspects like the operating system and framework, because of its role in the overall safety and dependability of the whole software system, the research as a precondition for innovative products, and the man-machine interface, which is indispensable for conveying information to the user as well as allowing the user to interact with the robot. The issues that have been faced stem from the hierarchical, layered construction of a complex mechatronic product, where the operation of the machine depends on the smooth cooper ation of each layer; In the same way, the overall safety is undermined by the least reliable piece building the system.

AB The Mechanical Engineering Department at Kettering University has completed development of a significant new component of education in mechatronics. The work began in the fall of 1997 as the principal part of an award for "Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement" by the Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation. It has culminated with the successful implementation of two undergraduate courses in mechatronics, two mechatronics laboratories and a website to support the educational endeavors of the mechatronics students. As will be described in this paper, the first course and its laboratory exercises are designed specifically to provide the students with meaningful experiences in the applications of mechatronics design principles. The knowledge gained in this first course will be applied in the second course, where the fundamental focus is to provide a complete experience in the innovation, design and fabrication of a new mechatronic product. This is all done in a team environment. The long-term goal is to integrate business management students into the product development team to provide marketing support.

AB Optimization of machine tools using a virtual prototype. High productivity and precision are the key success factors that force machine tool builders to constantly enhance the motion dynamics of their products. This article presents a concept for the methodical application of different engineering tools (CAE-tools) throughout the design process. While FEM analysis and optimization tools for example support the mechanical design of the frame structure a mechatronic model is needed to evaluate the interactions between mechanical, electrical and software components. Based on a multibody approach the dynamic motion behavior can be predicted including the stiffness of the frame structure, the dynamics of the feed drives, the NC motion path interpolation, the axis controller and the machining process.

AB The requirements for increased security, economy, comfort, and a better environmental impact produces a higher scale of integration at the system level. Here mechatronic components become more and more relevant as a determining factor for technology change from mechanics to electronics to computer science in the automobile. With the continually growing complexity of the system, and at the same time ever shorter product cycles, the cost and development load force us to see the system as a whole and use as far as possible automated computer aided development processes. Mechatronics provides a method of resolution for this problem and prepares a platform for the development of innovative automobile products, services, and processes in the future, which are predominantly influenced by miniaturization.

AB An innovative laser restoration tool for non-contact cleaning of painted artworks is developed. Accurate beam manipulation techniques in combination with on-line detection make the system suitable for selective cleaning of delicate surfaces. The utilisation of lasers obviates the use of various chemicals, and provides a method to remove layers that are untreatable using conventional methods. The first professional laser cleaning station for paintings is equipped with a modern mechatronic engineering tool for accurate beam manipulation (`optical arm'). An intelligent combination of software and hardware enables accurate control, necessary to deal with the variable properties of the artworks to be treated. An on-line monitoring system is incorporated, using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. The user interface plays an important role in simulating the `hands-on' treatment. In January 1999, the 2-year European co-operative research project `Advanced workstations for controlled laser cleaning of artworks' started. The research objective is to define the boundary conditions in which laser cleaning with the present technology can be safely applied. © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Many Mechanical Engineering Departments have recently or are now developing programs and/or courses in mechatronics. The emphasis of these programs/courses varies from institution to institution. The programs at four Canadian universities are described briefly and a new elective course in mechatronics at Queen's University is described in detail. The primary objective of the course is to create a sense of opportunity and excitement about mechatronics system design. This course focuses on the practical implementation of simple mechatronic systems with particular emphasis on the electronics for conditioning and interfacing of sensor signals and driver control signals. The laboratory portion of the course is based on the Basic Stamp II, a user friendly microcontroller from Parallax Inc. By the end of the course, students understand a relatively simple system of sensors and actuators under the supervision of a microprocessor engaged in on/off or simple PID control.

AB The recent focus on teaching microprocessor interfacing and control has been fueled in part by the abundance of inexpensive computational power available for use in products ranging from bread makers to toys. The range of applications of computer-controlled devices is not yet known, but many companies are racing more and more new designs into production. Colleges and Universities across the nation are scrambling to develop mechatronics courses, research, and even degrees in order to meet the demands of these industrial innovations. One area in mechatronic systems that promises new growth and challenges for industry as well as diverse and interesting learning challenges for academia is in the area of computer controlled fluid power systems. Fluid power systems are used in a wide variety of applications, and operate with various levels of complexity that can offer challenges at many levels in the classroom and laboratory setting. In this paper, we discuss the development of a mechatronics course at Iowa State University with a focus on the application of this technology to fluid systems.

AB Mechatronics has enabled "intelligent" machinery such as car antiskid braking systems to be created. Any new automotive development has to incorporate a large number of mechanical servo functions, and the range of functions and requirements in servo technology is growing apace. New actuator technologies, therefore, give fresh impetus to product development and accelerate progress. Piezoelectric actuators represent a new technology that offers a host of advantages. In combination with signal-processing electronics, the good mechanical and electrical integratability of piezoelectric actuators make these devices key elements in innovative, intelligent systems. This paper presents prototype applications. Particular attention is focused on powerful large-displacement piezoelectric actuators. The article also includes concrete characterization of piezoelectric actuator elements. To this end specific static and dynamic measurement methods were developed to characterize the elements under temperature and load influences.

AB The current trends in development and deployment of advanced electromechanical systems have facilitated the unified activities in the analysis and design of state-of-the-art motion devices, electric motors, power electronics, and digital controllers. This paper attacks the motion control problem (stabilization, tracking, and disturbance attenuation) for mechatronic systems which include permanent-magnet DC motors, power circuity, and motion controllers. By using an explicit representation of nonlinear dynamics of motors and switching converters, we approach and solve analysis and control problems to ensure a spectrum of performance objectives imposed on advanced mechatronic systems. The maximum allowable magnitude of the applied armature voltage is rated, the currents are limited, and there exist the lower and upper limits of the duty ratio of converters. To approach design tradeoffs and analyze performance (accuracy, settling time, overshoot, stability margins, and other quantities), the imposed constraints, model nonlinearities, and parameter variations are thoroughly studied in this paper. Our goal is to attain the specified characteristics and avoid deficiencies associated with linear formulation. To solve these problems, an innovative controller is synthesized to ensure performance improvements, robust tracking, and disturbance rejection. One cannot neglect constraints, and a bounded control law is designed to improve performance and guarantee robust stability. The offered approach uses a complete nonlinear mechatronic system dynamics with parameter variations, and this avenue allows one to avoid the conservative results associated with linear concept when mechatronic system dynamics is mapped by a linear constant-coefficient differential equation. To illustrate the reported framework and to validate the controller, analytical and experimental results are presented and discussed. In particular, comprehensive analysis and design with experimental verification are performed for an electric drive. A nonlinear bounded controller is designed, implemented, and experimentally tested.

AB With increased pressures coming from global competition and requirements for greater innovation in product development, designers are hard pressed to deliver designs of higher quality and variety using a repertoire of technological options from different disciplines. This interdisciplinary product development approach has not only removed many of the traditional constraints to design but has now given designers a much wider freedom of choice as to the best solution to a design problem. The focus of this paper is a knowledge-based design environment called Schemebuilder, which is a comprehensive and integrated suite of software tools aimed at supporting the designer in the rapid development of product design models in the conceptual, through embodiment stages of design. Illustrated is the use of the software tools in the qualitative generation of alternative schemes, by application of stored working and decomposition principles in the development of a function-means tree-like information structure. With mechatronic product development as the main theme, this paper describes a closely integrated methodology that incorporates a bond graph approach to continuous-time energetic systems and high-level Petri nets for the rigorous description of discrete-time information systems. Additionally, a technique is suggested for the decomposition of free format statements of need into the rigorously defined design context and required functions, which form the starting point of the function-means development process.

AB The aim of this presentation is to publish the results achieved by the use of a mathematical modeling technique invented and applied in the development of different mechatronic units as drives and actuators. Such activity belongs to the profile of both Departments for several years. In the first part of the presentation detailed description of the modular technical system built up of electric and electronic components and end-effectors is given. Each of these components was developed at different industrial companies separately. The particular mechatronic unit under consideration was constructed by the use of the appropriate mathematical model of these units. The unified model describing the whole system was developed with the integration of the models valid to the particular components. In the phase of testing the models a program approximating typical realistic situations in terms of work-loads and physical state of the system during operation was developed and applied. The main innovation here presented consists in integrating the conclusions of professional experiences the developers gained during their former R&D activity in different professional environments. The control system is constructed on the basis of classical methods, therefore the results of the model investigations can immediately be utilized by the developer of the whole complex system, which for instance may be an industrial robot.

AB This paper describes the importance which German Universities attach to "Mechatronics" and the way in which it is pursued there. It deliberately refrains from adding a new definition of "Mechatronics" to those already existing. Two concrete examples taken from University research should rather demonstrate that the two terms "Process Automation" and "MSR-Technik", which are commonly used in Germany, cover both the content and procedures of Mechatronics, completely. Moreover, the two examples-active damping system and inertial position measuring-show that innovative mechatronic products are essentially due to successful material research and to the progress in computer technology, as well as to the fast electronic processing of signals and algorithms. © 1993.

AB This paper describes the experiences gained in product design practice by the firms participating in the subproject Systematic Design of a Mechatronic Product of the Finnish Mechatronics Research Program. A practical design guide for the task definition and conceptual design phases was compiled on basis of these experiences. The sub-method combinations and a number of choice supporting practices which were found to be the most feasible ones under actual working conditions are also described and critically analyzed. This paper describes how the combination of several methods, metamethodics, may be applied to improving the quality and put-through-times in product development and as part of the overall strategy of a company. © 1992.
